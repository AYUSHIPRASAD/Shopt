Britax B-Ready G3 Stroller,Britax B Ready G3 Stroller Review Demo!,"Learn more about the upgraded B-Ready g3 Stroller from Britax! Amazing features include reversible seat, large underseat basket ...",M3j3fESwE00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3j3fESwE00,34197,123,2019-01-01T15:17:32Z,Music hi I m Kate from red tags and I m here to show you our third generation of the B READY stroller this just came out summer of 2018 we ve couple new beautiful fashions happens to be the Navy and I m going to just show you all the great configurations that the stroller can create so starting out this is what it looks like when you take it out of the box you ve got two larger wheels in the back two lot smaller wheels in the front and you do have a top seat now there s a lot more that this stroller does but if you re just buying it as a single stroller you can start out with the seat facing forward or by using our click and go adapters which are included in the stroller system you can turn your seat around so that the child is facing you one of the things that you want to remember is that this seat is good from 6 months until 55 pounds so if you are purchasing this for a first child and you re gonna want to use it as a travel system you want to make sure that you have a car seat that is compatible with this system now all of our vertex car seats are compatible I m going to demonstrate it with our B same ultra so you want to take the cars of the stroller seat out and then we ll pop the car seat into the click and go again you don t have to get any other adaptors for this to fit together and for safety reasons you really want that child to be looking at you you don t want them facing out of the world if they re a newborn so see how it works together very very easily now a couple of features on the stroller that we ll go over before we go back to the seat would be just look at how much basket space you have down here super oversized now when the child is sitting on top and if they are sleeping perhaps in the reclined position sometimes it s difficult to access the basket now this one s not too bad unless you have a child sitting down below but the good part is you do have access to that basket from the front and it s a pretty large access point right there so you can really get a lot down there access it from the front or the back now reclaiming that seat very simple as well there s just a little lever right here so you have about four different positions that you can change the seat to depending on your child s comfort level there is a ballet bar right here that they can hold on to but it is removable as well so if you want to add a snack tray we do have a snack tray option it s an accessory that you would purchase separately that fits right into here now you do have an oversized canopy that has a peekaboo window and we got rid of the velcro so it s nice and quiet so if your child is sleeping they re not going to be able to hear it this just folds down nicely right here so you can peep into the child s seat from where you re standing now speaking about where you re standing I m pretty short but there s plenty of ferren s out there that are much taller than me so I typically would have my handle bar down here or right here in the middle just for comfort reasons now if you re a really tall parent I m gonna just turn the stroller to the side you can see how tall that is this would be way too tall for me but for some of those six-foot parents it s perfect you also have a handle guide right here that if you re carrying a lot and you can only push the stroller with one hand it actually has great maneuverability and you can control it without one hand now if you want to build upon the stroller and really get into the special qualities of the stroller system we have 12 different configurations and I m going to show you a couple of them so we ll leave the top seat on and I m going to make some adjustments to the bottom because in order to add the lower adapter or the lower seat we need the basket to be folded within itself just to have a little bit better access point so this just pops off very easily and then fold it into itself like that and we can add the second seat I find it easiest if I hold the legs right here when I m attaching it to the back of the stroller and I usually lock the stroller just to keep it in place so it s not rolling away when I attach this back seat here and this little knob right here slides right into the frame of the stroller very very easily again on both sides and I just want to make sure these are lined up and locked and then I just bring the seat into a more upright position I m going to take off the top seat to show you what it would look like if you were to use it in travel system mode now if you re going to add the top seat on you want to give that lower child a little bit extra space so these the adapter extenders right here come with the bottom seat as well as the adapter the lower adapter and you can use it with either one but you don t want to put the top seat on these seat extenders really all it s meant for is the bassinet which is also sold separately or the infant car seat so that fits like that and you can actually recline the seat down here perfect if you re carrying two children now the benefit of this is that you re still one footprint you re not taking up a double wide position on this stroller as well as there s no extra weight in the front of the stroller all the weight is in the back so it s just much much more easier to maneuver now to take that out and see you re a family with an older child and you have a newborn typically that older child doesn t want anything different in his or her lifestyle you don t want to disrupt it too much you re gonna leave the older child on top and we re gonna put the newborn on the bottom which can be kind of confusing at first so I m going to show you the demonstration we re gonna take the bottom seat off hops off very easily now the basket here unzips so that you can add the adapter on just makes it a little bit easier for it to attach this is what the lower adapter looks like and what the car seat is going to attach to just want to line it up and you re gonna hear that click well add the car seat is our be safe ultra and you re gonna have a car seat facing in if you pull up the canopy the child s better protected that way because they re on a lower position you want to keep that child nice and protective but if you need to access the child for any reason just pull the canopy back or you can take the top seat off so it lines up just like this locks into place and then the big brother can sit right here and he ll never even know his little sister s down below and here you have a system for two children you can stroll away and still have one single footprint of the stroller and again the whole purpose of adding the seat to the back is to keep the seat weight managed better if you put more weight on the bottom of the front two wheels even if you re on a flat surface it feels like you re pushing uphill so this basically manages the weight a little bit better for all all the systems now if you want to do it with two car seats there s no other adapters that you need to purchase because like I said the stroller system comes with the clicking go adapters attached to it so I m just gonna get another car seat so if you re having twins right from birth you can actually see what that would look like so I have the be say 35 here I m gonna lock it right into place and now we have a system for two newborns fix the handle here so it s better for me and it does look when you re looking at it like this that that top seats a little bit too close to that bottom seat so this is where we would use our adapter extenders again and we just simply pop them into place and you re going to see a vast difference with that car seat pushed out like that and you can actually put a handle down and now that child down below you have full access to if you need to and of course the top one you do as well now I don t have the basket up here to show you but if you go to us protects comms you can see all the different configurations there
GB Pockit Air All-Terrain Stroller,GB Pockit Air All Terrain Stroller Review - From someone who really used it!,"A full review from someone who actually spent 30 days using the stroller. The good, the bad, and the ugly! Get it at Amazon -GB ...",_xMmNyeYtc4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xMmNyeYtc4,21453,227,2022-08-26T20:10:07Z,if you re looking for a travel stroller and you need something that is compact lightweight and great for traveling we tried the gb pocket air all-terrain stroller and this is our review this review is not sponsored it is the stroller of choice that we chose for our family vacation and we decided to try it tag along and we ll show you how we like it Music then you hate it when you open at youtube and it s like the review but they actually just unpacked it out of the box so they have never really used this stuff they have never really experienced work like actually using it and they re here recommending it well so today we re going to talk about the gb pocket air all-terrain stroller which i actually tested we took it for 30 days on our trip to europe with our toddler well actually he s a preschooler now so why did i decide to buy this one versus the yo-yo which is very famous or any other pocket strollers i needed something that was lightweight that was easy to fold up and down and that it was very compact to put away we were going to be traveling from cities to cities so i needed something that was very compact and easy and i didn t have my husband saying just don t take this stroller we re not gonna need it like you re a mother you know you always need it and i ll prove it to you the day that i didn t take it what happened as you know you always need the stroller so let s bring in a compact one so this one is the top lightest so there s others that might fold easier that might be more comfortable that might be a little bigger but in terms of weight this one is the light so i went with it and you can compact it so small it fits in a backpack Music lock in the front wheel so that i are not moving and this is going to make sure that the wheels are compacted do the same with the back using the white clip to fold the wheels in using your top handles look for the white button and then you re going to press those down at the same time and you re going to push down the gravity is going to pull it all down and then you can easily compact it side to side Music to open it up just open your stroller and push the white buttons at the same time give it a good shake so that the gravity can help put it down then open the back wheels and unlock the front wheels so that they swing back and forth and you are ready to go and yes there s a lazy way to do it and an easier one to do it avoid the whole wheel part and just push the buttons and push it down yes the wheels are going to stick out but it s a lot faster so let s go from the bottom to the top in terms of destroyer the wheels the wheels are very small they re very thin and my husband said this is not going to survive 30 days in europe because there s a lot of bumpy roads but the bad boys survived 30 days of constantly visiting cities over cities over cities there were times where i would be going with the stroller and a little bump in the road would be like boo boom like it doesn t have like a like a bicycle wheel where you can like bounce off and catch on itself quickly they re harder so if if you have like a little bump and you re not watching you can t you re gonna get like stuck like a speed bump moving on with the storage the storage is convenient it s small so in the bottom it has a little mesh bag it was great for putting our bags and our water bottle and his lunchbox so not not a big storage but just enough for a trip you always have a backpack anyway so we didn t really used it as much moving on to where the sitting area is this the straps came attached and i didn t realize it until like 15 days in so it was really uncomfortable for him to strap on and i didn t realize it was because it was like weirdly strapped on until i figure it out then i was able to loosen the straps uh which we were so used to not using the straps we just like forgot about it uh but they are comfortable they have the little uh regular meshy meshy thing but one of the things that i love is this mesh so the mesh makes it super lightweight and it also makes it very refreshing so some of the trips that we took some of the cities were extremely hot putting him in a stroller and having the peace of mind that he wasn t sweating his back because some of the strollers could get very hot like some of the car seats this is a regular mesh so he was able to like get the air in and out so he wasn t sweating it was actually comfortable this version of the stroller that i have does not lean back fall asleep this one does not lean back so he will constantly putting his head towards this metal which i didn t like because that i don t think that was very comfortable for him but i always had the blanket that we were using and i would like put it next to it so that he had a little bit of cushion so that s one of the things that maybe i was like oh i should have paid a little bit more but i think it was also bigger and heavier and that s why i decided not to my son is four so he could be fine just sleeping like that but if i had a toddler that take constant naps during the day i would definitely go with the one that leans back especially because we were out the whole day so it s not like it was just a quick moment until we could get to the hotel so he could sleep in a bed comfortably for his two three hour nap we were on the go all the time meaning he was gonna sleep his whole nap in the stroller so if you have a toddler uh i suggest getting the one that you can recline back and they ll be able to sleep a lot more comfortably moving on to the shade i thought the shade was a great idea because it actually flips back and front it s useless unless it s 12 o clock in the afternoon where the sun is completely down it s completely useless most of the strollers have a cocoon type of shade which is going to get cover the sun from all different sides this is just like a it s not even like the even the hats have like a little side thing right this one is like completely flat on the sun just comes from anywhere so i would use to just take that blanket and put it over him and make a little cocoon myself so don t rely on this i don t i don t like it it just it it didn t cover the sun in terms of the stability so when you close it you re gonna push it down uh it could get a little flimsy right like it s it s if so it s a little flimsy because it flips down and sometimes when you drive you know it could get like a little squiggly uh but i was like this thing is gonna break this thing is not gonna survive this is like putting a lego piece together but it survived it worked fine it didn t break every it was stable so it was just really my perception of the stroller but it was compactable so you can assume that it s going to have a little bit less stability in terms of how comfortable it is to push so i always felt like it was squiggling a little bit especially when we re like going through the heavy rocks and stuff but overall i think the stroller is was a great option it s a great purchase i am actually preferring this one now that i m home over my regular stroller today we are going to canada for a week vacation and again we re going to be sharing a car with my sister and her nephews and i want to make sure that i can take the stroller with me and we re not going to have a problem because the stroller is long it s not going to fit we have bags so i m taking this comfortable knowing that we re going to be able to fit it in so i hope this video was helpful for you in really understanding what the stroller can do and what it did for me 30 days all over europe so we really really used it and i did try to make notes of everything that i was liking and didn t like so that you when you purchase yours you have real reference on what it is to use this specific stroller i really enjoyed documenting it and testing it for you so i ll see you on the next video my name is alexa and if you don t know me i m a sensory teacher i m a mom for a four year old i do me classes i do sensory classes and i love all things about play come along subscribe because i have all the goodness coming for you

GB Pockit Air All-Terrain Stroller,Best Ultra-Light Travel Stroller GB Pocket Air,"Traveling with kids is not easy, but the GB Pockit Air stroller makes it a little bit more manageable! This pram has made taking a ...",2beirrSdPxM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2beirrSdPxM,17138,85,2023-08-02T21:11:34Z,hello people Philip blank here and today we ve got an excellent product that has made traveling with the child significantly easier the GB pocket air stroller I found the GB to be one of the lightest and smallest options really making it an ultralight and Ultra compact setup but with this ultralight minimalism it does bring in some sacrifices so we ll get into that Music now at this point we flew in the stroller about 10 times and while there are other options out there I found the GB to be probably the smallest and lightest option now the pocket air all-terrain stroller is made by GB and GB is a company under the good baby Holdings International which is Incorporated in the Cayman Islands but it s headquartered in Shanghai from what I can tell on our website gb s design work is all done in Bavaria Germany so it s a global company with German designs but you can definitely tell the attention to detail in this product fully collapsed the stroller packs to about 10 by 14 by seven yeah it s insane how small this thing gets your airline workers are pretty shocked when we collapse it as you normally are required to tag and Stow the stroller earlier on but we use it all the way up to the gate and then collapse it and store it right in the overhead now it s far smaller than most people s carry-on backpacks but you can fully collapse it and put it into if y all Ravine 17-inch laptop cankin bag the way the stroller is 10.4 pounds and while there are no carrying handles you can kind of just grab it by the handle when you carry it around quickly now for the design there are a lot of umbrella strollers out there you have the ones that collapse all together but I just absolutely love the Ingenuity of how compact this thing goes when you flip it all together now to do the collapse you have the two buttons on the top handles that you push together and then from there you ll do just a push together and collapse motion now you want to keep your wheels straight and then when it folds up it just flips in kind of like a briefcase there and then it pivots in half now I ve gotten really quick at doing this just walking up to the gate flip down and go but occasionally I ll still kind of have some issues if you don t have your wheels straight it won t fold up super easily now with that fold you have two fold patterns here there are hinges on the rear wheels that flip up and bring this lower wheel up into this space right in here for most instances this is plenty small so I usually don t worry about that but when we do the overhead storage we re stress do it away compact in your closet I ll go and do the extra method there after some practice flipping it out really is quite simple you have the lock in the middle you flip it left and right and then you ll just do a forward motion with the levers up and you do have a simple brake system on the back right wheel it s got a brake wire that runs from one wheel to the other so both Wheels do lock with the engagement of the right foot brake now getting into the ergonomics for the parent this stroller only has two height settings it s either tall or short and I m about the absolute Max height you can be I m six foot and the tall height is right at around the minimum of my comfort level if you re about five eight kind of the average height of a person that s really ideal setup and you can also drop it down lower if you re a little less gifted in stature but walking downhill as a six foot person you really start to lose the comfort and max out the size for this thing now the stroller does have this wire mesh sun visor but it really doesn t do anything unless the sun is directly overhead but I guess they just wanted to include it not adding much weight just flips down here on the back now looking at the comfort of the stroller for your kid or who s ever kid you happen to be pushing around stroller was designed for kids from six months up all the way to about 55 pounds you don t typically want babies younger than that as they won t be able to hold their head up very well and they ll have an age limit but typically five or six until you hit that 55 pound Mark then you re just putting too much stress on the stroller itself now you got the basic webbing straight wraps here and then the adjustable part of it is recessed behind the pads which are sewn into the straps here once you set it they re not really quick adjustment like your car seat you really just set it and then leave it there you also have a very slight adjustment down here on the bottom for your buckle but it s just got some a little bit of padding on the webbing itself now I do wish for this expensive of a stroller they would have gone with a higher quality webbing just something either a little bit softer and a finer and Tighter weave but it s not terrible it does a good job the bottom of the stroller does have a softer foam with the polyester cover here and then from the midways all the way up it s a clear mesh just to allow for more airflow less sweat for your child it s not going to be a good cold weather stroller unless you bundle them up quite a lot as the air will come through on the back of the stroller another feature that the stroller has mainly for the folding mechanism is these fret locks in the left and right Wheels this just keeps your wheel straight so when you do collapse it down you don t have any pivoting motion and then that s a little more reliable in the folding action you have the foot rest on the front which is one of the things I ve seen people break make sure if you have a larger child they re not jumping on this because if it does rip here you re gonna have to just cut off both sides and go without the foot plate with Twitter have your child s feet kind of dragon in the wheels and then you also have underneath a little storage container just for a brief say a little jacket or blanket any toys there and then we have a little ear tag that we have dangling down below so if we re flying a smaller plane and they request to take it out the gates we ve got a tracker on it we ve had so many Uber drivers taxi drivers stewardesses just we ll walk up and flip it they ll just kind of stare at it like whoa what happened so it s like a little Transformer of a stroller and just the weight overall it s it s incredibly lightweight now getting into the cons of this stroller first off this is a very Niche stroller focused on being ultra light and good for travel we ve also got a full-size Mockingbird stroller which has the little tray table for the baby and then addition to that we have a Thule running stroller more for jogging with larger Wheels uh quite a bit easier to roll and then while our child was the infant we used our Dune a lot for travel but when he outgrew that then we came into the pocket it would be hard for this to be your only stroller unless you really don t walk or use strollers very often anyways and the other huge con to be aware of is while this says it s the pocket air all-terrain this thing does not work at all on Sand if you push it there it just completely stops you kind of have to pull it backwards to get the weight off of it it also really struggles in thick grass like a thicker Zoysia it really is not made for that it does pretty well on like a rough asphalt a cobblestone you can get up and down curb pretty easily especially going backwards pulling it up and down stairs has been pretty good but it is not all terrain it s really focused on just the ultralight compact travel and city stroller and because this is such a light stroller you can really feel the aluminum flexing as you push it if you re going over cobblestones there is no suspension of any kind and the entire the entire stroller kind of just flexes back and forth even with the child in it as you push it feels kind of flimsy but it feels just like an ultralight camping chair as opposed to say a full-size lawn chair now we dug a lot into other people s reviews before I purchased it and from what I ve seen most people have very positive reviews but if you do break something say you break a wheel or you break the little strap for the child s feet there is terrible customer service and really no way to replace any of the parts now that part really sucks because you re paying almost 200 for the stroller you would hope that if it breaks you d get it fixed but it looks like you re going to be out of luck now despite these cons I have been super impressed and very satisfied with the overall design and use of the product the ultra compactness is really what I was searching for I knew it would come with the set prices that it has and for me being able to completely collapse it and pack it down and just store it in the over head is far more valuable than having a large plush stroller with suspension and the extra bonuses I think if you have your expectations sit accurately to what this product is and when it s not product can definitely streamline the traveling with a toddler experience so if you you already have your diaper bags and your carry-on bags having one much much smaller item to deal with has just made traveling that much easier now I would buy again the eight months I ve had it I ve been the very content customer and really no issues with it so let me know if you have any questions or comments on the product down below I ll be happy to get back with you so thank you for your time have a good day Music

Bugaboo Donkey 5 Stroller,Bugaboo Donkey5 Review Single-To-Double Strollers Best Strollers 2022 Magic Beans Reviews,"The stroller world is buzzing with excitement about the new Bugaboo Donkey5 stroller, and you may be wondering what all the ...",P0FMCaduRjI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0FMCaduRjI,58659,399,2022-01-26T14:00:16Z,if you re shopping for strollers or researching strollers and the bugaboo donkey is on your list you have come to the right place because i m going to show you the bugaboo donkey 5. i m ellie from magibeans videos and i m really excited about showing you the stroller it is a single stroller going to a double stroller as you may know i had many strollers in my time with my three kids and if i could do it all over again i would start with a bugaboo donkey so four apparently is bad luck in china it s like 13 on an elevator in some places in america so uh we skipped the four they go from street from three to donkey five and here is the full review of the stroller so you can see this starts as a mono this is a stroll that starts from a single stroller and converts to a double stroller it also comes with a bassinet included and a side luggage basket included now you have to get the side luggage basket people say could you get a full size seat you can t you get the side luggage basket but people love this thing you put all your stuff in it recently they ve added this cool little integrated zipper compartment so you can put all your stuff in it and it doesn t come out you can zip it up and you can put it away and it is just super organized or you can just throw stuff on top of the side luggage basket and it just removes there s no clicking or anything like that as you can see also we have this set up in the bassinet position now this stroller comes with a bassinet and it comes with a toddler seat which i m going to show you in a second and so you can use this from newborn lying flat you can also use this um with a car seat adapter you can do this with a twin car seat adapter it s a great stroller for twins and so that is the deal with the bassinet there s a wonderful air rated mass bassinet mattress in here so there s a mattress it s nice for air flow through it s very comfortable for the baby and also for the bugaboo donkey 5 which is an upgrade they added this air ventilation sort of peekaboo window so if you re in a warm climate or in the summer and you want the air to flow through as the baby is breathing you can put this little peekaboo window on the back of the best and the other thing about the bassinet is that the way they designed it and you could probably see this in here you can easily remove the these um support pieces so you can fold it right down so if you re like trying to throw your bassinet into the trunk for the weekend it is way easier with the bugaboo donkey 5 to just fold down this bassinet super super easy so let me show you how to expand this from a single stroller into a double stroller so the single position is only 23 inches wide it isn t super super wide but and then when it goes to a double position it goes to 30 inches wide or just under 30 inches wide so it fits through a standard size door don t worry it s really easy to move the seat components you push these buttons push and this removes right away then you remove the side luggage basket and now you have this basic frame oh it s really light so if you re adding your car seats to this very very light now we want to expand this into a double stroller so what you do is there are three clicks there s a little little clip right here there s a clip here on the bottom and there s a clip here on the front and then if you look in the middle of that sort of axle bar not some axle bar but like a middle bar in the middle there s a little button you lean in on the side as my recommendation and you pull it right out and now it is double wide and you close these clips back up again a pro tip if you are having trouble closing the clips there s nothing wrong with it just pull it out all the way and it clips right on no problem let me grab the toddler seat so in the most recent versions of the donkey these seats hold up to 50 pounds so you can see it is the toddler seat um i don t have a canopy for this but it s the same canopy for the bassinet as for the toddler seat and i will put on the bassinet click to you and then i will put this on with the actual um toddler seats you can see you can there s like this is this is like i said i would if i could do it again my two older kids are 23 months apart when i have the baby and my toddler back in the day it would been so convenient i can have the toddler facing out and the baby facing in i could have two toddler seats if i want the toddler to face me i just turn the seat around and have it face me last year in 2021 i did a video called confused about the bugaboo donkey where i go through all of the different mono and duo and twin and do extension sets and all the different technical things around the donkey so if you are confused about um how to buy a donkey and what all the components mean i ll put a card up above so that you can go and click that and watch it after this video but let me continue about the donkey five and i m gonna talk to you a little bit about what are some of the more up some more of the upgrades between the donkey three and the donkey five okay more things about the donkey um the donkey five is there s this soft touch fabric um in 2021 they came up with this soft touch fabric for the fox 3 and now for the donkey 5 they have this color palette this muted beautiful muted tones and soft touch fabric now let me show you how to fold this because in the fold there is another there are two elements of the fold which makes this um different for um than the donkey three okay just going to remove the basting out again if they re two seats on you can fold it with the bass and attach it s not as elegant for demonstration purposes i m going to show you how to um fold the donkey five okay great so the first thing i normally do is i push in this handlebar again these little clips on the side is how you adjust the handlebar and now a difference between the three and the five is the five had a different folding mechanism the see this white thing on top of the handlebar this is on top it used to be on the bottom so you had to like grab your finger and put it underneath this is the a mechanism similar to their other strollers like the fox has a mechanism like this the bee has a mechanism like this so now it s on the top it s way easier to use and you just put your fingers on that and you fold it down to the bottom and then you just pull it and it folds closed and it can stand on its own as you see it you can just like pop it in your car um it isn t necessarily the smallest stroller for your car but again you can um compress this down into a single stroller like go into the model position and make this actually quite small pretty good to open the stroller back up this is another difference between the last version this version is that what you used to have to do is to lift to open it up you d have to pull those little white pieces again and then lift it but now all you have to do is just grab the handlebar and it flips right open so so super easy so it s easier to open and easier to fold more differences is there is a connection point down here on the bottom for to add a comfort wheel board that is a huge difference so you can actually have three kids ride around on this the twin and then add a comfort wheel board on the back and there s an integrated adapter so you just click your bugaboo wheel board right back on to the back of the stroller there s also a graphite frame which is really really beautiful um and the last thing is that the seat is just three inches is three centimeters higher than the previous version so it s a little bit taller so the baby can face you to turn the seat around again just pick it up and push it down the bugaboo donkey 5 is also featured in our stroller buying guide at mbeans.com which i ll put a link in the description below and is also featured in our best strollers of 2022 which is coming out in just a couple weeks so like this video and subscribe today i ll see you at the next video Music

Bugaboo Donkey 5 Stroller,Bugaboo Donkey 5 Stroller Review Double Stroller Review,More than double the fun! Melissa is joined with Kyra from Bugaboo to showcase the incredible Donkey 5 stroller as a part of our ...,6o1K1GAVFCs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o1K1GAVFCs,25243,113,2023-06-02T17:34:41Z,hi friends it s Melissa here from Snuggle Bugs today I am here with Kira from Bugaboo welcome thank you so much for having me thank you for being here Kira is here today as part of our brand Spotlight series we are going to be talking about the Bugaboo donkey 5 stroller I personally love this stroller as an owner of the donkey 5 myself so I can t wait to chat with you today about all of the features and benefits of this amazing stroller Music I m a proud owner of the donkey myself so I can t wait to chat with you about this amazing stroller it s the only stroller on the market that goes from single mode to a side-by-side double stroller so we re going to walk you through the full features and show you all the different variations of the stroller today so Kira take it away so this is our Bugaboo donkey 5 stroller so as Melissa said it is a single to double stroller and it expands side by side but before we get there we are looking at it as a mono stroller so that is for one child what s really great about it for one child is you have your one s child here that can go up to 50 pounds and then you have all this extra storage space next to you that can hold 22 pounds plus you have the under seat basket which holds another 22 pounds so you can hold a lot of stuff in here a lot like this is the I ideal grocery shopping 100 running errands stroller like ice stuff that basket to the gills and what s really great about it is that once it s stuffed you can pop it off with the handles and bring it inside yeah so you don t have to worry about like carrying all the items in your hands to try to carry it in the house it comes with its own bag to bring it in and it has a zipper so you can keep things contained or if little hands are trying to get snacks when they re no more or if it s raining or snowing that s also a really nice feature along with some of our other great features we have our extendable sun canopy which offers really nice coverage and protection for the child one of the best in the market for sure like I love a good canopy and the fact that this fully protects baby from the sun is actually super important you don t really like the sun is beaming on them sometimes when it s like midday and you re going out for a walk so that full coverage really does make a huge huge difference in the performance of a stroller I also what I love about it is that it really blocks out light when your child is trying to nap so you can really let them nap here you don t have to cover with blankets or anything it can easily be covered and you have our nice little peekaboo window here but you can also cover it up if they want no light whatsoever so you really have a lot of different positions for the sun canopy based on what the child wants some days they want full coverage some days they want to see the world completely so we give you that option and it s also water resistant like our sun canopy and our seat fabric all the other Fabrics as well they re all machine washable so machine wash coldly flat to dry because we know kids accidents happen totally yeah so really great feature donkey 5 also has the ability to have the seat facing the world we can pop it off we can turn it around so seat can face parent pushing and then we have three recline positions when facing parent so we have our sleeping baby we we have our relaxed baby and then we have our active baby and then facing world we have two positions active and relaxed so you have different options for your child based on what their needs are and just talking about our Growing Child we have our no re-thread harness so it just Glides Up and Down based on where they need it which is really great also because the stroller is a double you don t necessarily have to keep one child in one and one in the other right if they re different heights you can easily Just Adjust based on what seat they get in also something like everything which is my toddler he you know he sees baby brother going in the one seat so he wants to be in that seat so it s we re constantly up and down with the harness and this definitely makes it super easy to do that and then easily to adjust because they re probably different sizes you it s just a simple adjustment of the harness which is really nice and easy so it makes it super easy we have that button in the center opens all the clips so really nice easy to use harness I m going to take you to our handlebar because we all have different heights and partners have different heights so what s really great about the donkey is that it does go it s quite low it is one of the lowest on the market and it goes very high so no matter what your height is whether it s you pushing it Grandparents pushing it you have that ability to kind of find whatever your happy medium is and push yes it s really beneficial for me because my husband s a lot taller than me like I we always change it my toddler has recently decided that he wants to be the stroller for sure so he ll now open the tabs himself and push it down so that he can push baby brother home from daycare it s quite adorable I can tell you that yes this is literally the perfect height for a child to push it my daughter when she was learning to walk would hold it even now she wants to be and I want to push yes so they can push too which is really nice feature as well um taking to the back of the stroller we of course have our break and we have our nice under seat basket we also have a pocket in the under seat basket which is where we can always keep things like our rain cover which comes included in the box or I personally always keep up a pack of diapers and wipes because you never know when something bad s gonna happen so it gives you that ability to always have something with you on the go so this is the donkey as a mono stroller so for one child um so what s nice to know is that we re only 24 inches wide so we re the same width as our other stroller the fox 5. so it s an optical illusion that we might look a little bigger um so it s not as big as it s perceived and then when we expand to double which I ll show you soon we re only going to be 29 inches wide so still not as wide as our standard door we ll talk about the have mine in double all day every day I go through all the doors in daycare and all anywhere that I m running errands and I ve never had an issue getting through the door with my donkey in double people are always like let me let me help you or do you need to leave your stroller outside and I m like no no I got this and I just stroll right on through it is not a problem yeah it s 29 inches wide so the standard door has to be 30 inches wide for a wheelchair so you will fit through any public space we want to so also in the box since you were chatting uh the rain cover comes in the box so ultimately what you re getting with the donkey 5 stroller is the frame the basket your toddler s seat and the seat frame and the seat Fabric and you re also getting the fabric for the pram so you can use it from birth right out of the box exactly um our pram comes in the Box as you mentioned and what s really nice about the pram is let s just pop it off and pop it on just to show some of the details um is some of the new features are we have this window down here so it allows for breathe Breezy capabilities and what s actually really nice is because this can be a twin stroller when you have both twins next to each other and you have it up they can actually see each other through so that s really nice and cute because they re not actually in the same Brands together but they can still interact with each other and I love the the apron yeah so it easily pops open and then if you were to zip the sun canopy you ll get almost full coverage so there is absolutely no sun on baby which is really important as well yeah so it is amazing coverage yes and people always say oh is black gonna overheat no no it does not so your baby is going to be nice and cool and comfortable especially with that additional ventilation in the canopy and in the pram I like it s great it s perfect it s gonna show this seat is on the floor so I just want to say this is actually a toddler seat on the floor so if you re at the park you want to have a picnic or you go to someone s house yeah and they don t have a seat for your child your child can sit in this on the floor and it s a great seat for them too so it s just like another use for our products totally Music so this is our adapter for the car seat foreign there we go so this is the Nuna Pepa car seat that we have on the stroller and this is I love how baby is nice and close to you yes that s so wonderful and you can use the Mono car infant car seat adapter when you have it in double mode as well so exactly in my case I had baby in the infant seat for a while and my toddler in the toddler seat right beside and that was adorable there s actually 17 different configurations that you can do with the donkey stroller between toddler seat car seat pram mixing it up for twins one child two kids of different ages now with twins it s actually a double adapter like it s double wide correct you wouldn t use two of the mono adapter no you get the double adapter and then you pop that on and then you can put your two car seats on that as well love that okay perfect amazing now you can fold with the seat in with the storage basket but I think for the sake of today we ll show it folded just with smallest form but yeah you can fold it if you need it with the seat or the pram or the storage basket any way it does work perfect um so I always like to lower the handlebar just to make it the most compact fold yeah um and then I always like to say it s like using a water gun yeah everyone s played with a water gun when they re little you pull these buttons up and then you just tuck it in and then here is it folded easy to put in a car um you can kind of Tuck the seat in this way or you can flip it the other way I know it it s a bigger stroller so it s a bigger fold but yes we constantly we were chatting before this video that I constantly am bringing my donkey in and out of the vehicle with both full-on toddler seats attached and what s really nice about the donkey 5 is that when you open it there s no buttons to do so I m just going to grab the handlebar and pop it open oh love just like that that s easy yeah it s nice amazing okay let s talk how it expands yes important to know there are three clips and they re white so they re all going to be the main bars of the stroller yeah so one at the top handle one down here in the front and then one down in the back and then we have a little button in the center here you just push the button and separate it you want to give them all the bars just a nice little tug to make sure it s open and close the clips I remember my my mother-in-law was taking the kids out and she s like I don t know about changing the stroller like making it from signal to double and I was like it is literally three clicks of a button and you re done like it s so fast and she did it no problem now this is the view of the donkey that I love when I had my second my toddler would sit in his little toddler seat I d have baby in the basket and they would just hold hands and like oh my goodness it is the sweetest honestly that s why we ve done side by side it gives them both the ability to interact with each other but also it gives them their own personal space as well um and it gives the ability for mom or dad or grandparents to give attention to both kids at the same time if you wanted to face both of them at the same time if you had twins yeah and as I mentioned the width of it is an optical illusion that it is so much wider than it is because it s only 29 inches wide standard wheelchair is 30 and will fit through any public door which is really nice so I ve first got the foot muff which is definitely one of our most used accessories it is one of my favorites so we live in Canada where it is cold 90 of the time it s pretty good even when it s kind of warm it s still kind of cold so you just want to pop the sun canopy off um and then it has this little kind of elastic in the back so I m just going to put the elastic over it so it makes sure that it stays nice and secure on it comes in a range of colors kind of choose what works for your your child yeah so this is our dual Comfort seat liner so what s really nice is it has two ways you can use it to pay bet depending on your comfort it comes in a range of colors and what s nice about it is it s actually moisture wicking so in really hot days it s going to help keep your baby nice and dry and it s going to cool them as well so not only is it great because when babies have accidents you just need to throw this in the wash and you don t have to take off all your Fabrics I just love that you can throw it in the wash oh 100 it makes your life so much you never expected that yeah machine wash a cold lay flat to dry and then so stains can kind of stay off all the fabric yes um adds some nice pop of color but also helps keep your child temperature regulated I love the parent organizer I m going to turn so I can show how it attaches to the stroller which is really great so it has Velcro so we re just going to attach it to the stroller what s really nice about it is how it comes off the stroller so I will talk about all the pockets in a second but more than that I feel like a little purse it is because if I need to go if I m at the park and I need to change my child I can act as like a mini diaper bag and I just take it off and I can go which is really great it has outside Pockets it has inside pockets on pockets on Pockets I do like the inside zipper that s where I keep my extra five dollars for when the ice cream truck comes by because I ve learned my lesson yes talk us through the Breezy canopy yes I m actually going to show you how it goes on because it is a lifesaver in the summer so this is I have to say I haven t gotten mine yet so you re selling me on okay so foot lock is my wintertime essential greasy sun canopy is my summertime essential so the Sun the canopy clamps and wires are already with your stroller so you re just going to feed them through um so I m going to just attach this here so what s really nice about our Breezy sun canopy is while it does still provide coverage it is super Breezy for the child so and you can switch up the color of your stroller without buying a whole new stroller 100 because it comes in a Range colors but amazing perk yes so you have the nice Breezy panels yes you have still art zipper for extendable Sun coverage Music this is like the the amount of zippers that is happening here oh here we go yes so you have extra there and then you can roll this up if they want to look out when it s closed which is honestly my daughter s favorite thing because she s covered but she can still see when dogs are coming because that s what she looks for ventilation on this is incredible oh but wait there s one more there s a zipper at the bottom with a built-in mosquito net stop oh we have to have one it doesn t quite work with the foot mouth because you won t have both on at the same time we re showing a real juxtaposition of Seasons here but it also has a built-in um mosquito net at the bottom so amazing great summer purchase allows airflow to go right through this isn t a range of colors this screams Cottage baby oh 100 100 yeah okay and it s the fabric is really nice that like dirty hands easily wipe right off you re absolutely right yeah I love that okay we ve got a couple other accessories have a snack snack tray and we ve got the cup holder so snack tray is a child s favorite yeah so you take off the rotating carry handle and you re gonna pop the snack tray right into the seat um what s really nice about it is that they now kind of put their drink in you slide it for treats you can also take it off so they have a just their own cup holder all dishwasher safe yes also I do I really like the versatility on that because I don t always allow snacks in the stroller depending on how messy this is oh 100 just having the drink kind of sets us up for Success that this is what we re doing and I like that it it s not a huge snack container because I can just put a little bit and I can close it um sometimes we do walks to daycare in the morning so I ll put her breakfast in there with her water and then on the way home she doesn t get the snack anymore yes absolutely so it s nice and easy it is super easy and then show us the cup holder as well I love it so we have integrated attachment points on the donkey five so right up in the center here there is a little bit of uh like a little knob and then we re just going to take the cup holder and connect it right on and then your cup holder can go in the center it does come with adapters as well if you want to place it in other places on the side or if you want two cup holders because sometimes one you can still fit the parent organizer on the side or in my case I have actually that I have the cup holder on the side here and then I just have my parent organizer in the front and so it s very much uh do what works for you wherever you want it 100 I mentioned that the stroller works for one child or two children of different ages or twins but it actually can also fit three kids so how we re gonna do that is we have our board with our wheel so what you re going to do is it s actually designed you ll notice that it it has a bit of a shape so based on which way you like to walk um you can choose which direction because your child s gonna stand on one side yes either I like because they re gonna stand on the side so whether you walk a little bit more on the left or a little bit more on the right you ll choose your side sold because I do have one where it s in the middle and I have to kind of walk along like this yeah so I love that it won t just be on one side okay so you can use the board when you re in double or single I love that some sometimes you can t so that s great to know and then what I like about it is you can easily pop the seat off throw it in the underseat basket if they don t need it yeah and you can also pop it up out of the way so brings you a little bit closer if they re not on it also of course when you re not in pram it goes up all the way so it can kind of stay out of your way easily pop it down child sits or stands in the middle when you get the duo extension kit that s to make it into the double mode that will come with another seat frame and your seat fabric correct and sun canopy and belly bar right and then it that seat holds 50 pounds right yes okay that s amazing right now I ve got both of mine in the two toddler seats they hold hands on the way home from daycare it s very sweet that s amazing okay well that is awesome thank you so much for walking us through the donkey it is a beloved stroller for so many reasons it s just so versatile I love that it goes to a side by side from single to double mode it s fantastic sick thank you so much for being here with us today for having me if you guys uh want to see more content like this please like And subscribe the video

Babyzen YOYO2 Stroller,BABYZEN YOYO 2 Stroller BABYZEN YOYO2 Full Review Magic Beans Best Lightweight Strollers,Check out our latest BabyZen YOYO2 review One of the most ...,zNLoCEjuzFk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNLoCEjuzFk,494605,1033,2020-03-03T05:00:07Z,"The BABYZEN YOYO2 is here in 2020 and there are a bunch of different improvements, most notably the fact that it has a 10 pound increase in the weight limit so it holds a bigger baby. We are super excited about it, it s one of our most popular travel strollers at Magic Beans. It is a stroller that customers are looking for, they re asking questions about, because they are traveling with their child, you re on the go, parents are super busy, and you re just wondering, what is the right travel stroller for your child? You can leave a comment below, I ll moderate the questions and you can give us a call at six one seven three eight three eight two five nine, and we ll answer your questions, yes your questions, will totally do that all for free. And here is the BABYZEN YOYO2. So we have the BABYZEN YOYO, one of my favorite strollers. It is a mini micro stroller, it s among the best of the mini micro strollers, and I m gonna show a full demonstration of it so you can decide whether this is the right stroller for you and for your family. You may be thinking about a travel stroller and you re seeing that they come in various price points. There are umbrella strollers that are 20 bucks that you can buy at the drugstore and then there are these mini micro strollers that fold into the overhead compartment of an airplane, and they re like less expensive and more expensive, it is so confusing, and you just want to have a really good quality stroller that you can just throw in your trunk or go for travel, and your mind might be spinning with this, so hopefully I m gonna be able to help you figure it out. This is the BABYZEN YOYO2. So it s the second generation of it, it is not a drastic update from the first one, but there s some really important features of it that are different, so before I get into the features, let me just show you what this stroller can do. So it is a stroller that can be used from newborn with a newborn kit. Also, you can add car seat adapters to it, to click in your your infant car seat. I ve done multiple videos of the BABYZEN YOYO on the channel, I ll put in the description below previous videos, but let me show you how this stroller folds down. There are a couple steps to it, but it s very, very easy and once you get it, it s like nothing. Okay. Step one, right by the bottom of the handlebar, there are buttons, and you just, in these little circles, you can put your thumbs on it and you just squeeze and you pull this under. Okay, then underneath here, just going to pick it up to show you, there is a white button and a random pull, pushing the white button, pull the red pull, you ll hear a little click, wonderful, click, hold on to the chrome handlebar, and it folds right down. And then there s a carry strap, really convenient, throw it over your shoulder, look how small this thing is. Under 15 pounds, very, very light, so if you re on the subway or on the T or going through an airport or whatever, or just even storing it in your closet, it is really, really small. It fits in overhead compartments of an airplane, which is really convenient for travel, so you don t have to gate check it. What an awesome thing! I usually just pop it open like a yo-yo. I demonstrated that slowly before, but you ll see once you get the hang of it. You just do this, you squeeze, it s really, really quick. To recline the stroller, they actually improved this for the YOYO2. You just pull this little loop on the back and this goes back down. This is the 6-month variety, so it s for six month plus, and I added this accessory, it s a leg rest which you can pull out and push down. So when your baby is actually little, you want their leg rest to be up, so their feet are more comfortable. So that s an accessory that you can get. In addition to that, again, this is great quality and you really get what you paid for, people. Absolutely love the stroller, we sold thousands of this thing and people just absolutely love it. Okay first thing is something you can t see, but something that they ve tested. This used to be right under 40 pounds as the weight limit, now it s right under 50 pounds, so it goes up to about 49 pounds or 48.5 pounds pounds as the upper weight limit, so that can carry a four or five year old with a lot. You can also add a buddy board to the back, a little ride-on board that BABYZEN makes so you can add a second child to stand behind it. The handlebar is leatherette, the trend in baby gear, many strollers have it, so it s nice that BABYZEN added the leatherette handlebar to the YOYO2. They added and improved the buckle, updated the buckle, beautiful logo on the front, easy to just pull apart, put the baby in and nicer straps on the side here. So they have four-wheel suspension, they had independent four-wheel systems, they had four-wheel suspension on the old one, but now they have independent four-wheel suspension, and on the wheels here you can see, lots of strollers have sort of like spring dispense suspension, but they added this. It s called hytrel elastomer, that s what it s called, it adds too, it s like instead of like a metal spring but it enables you to have really good suspension on like all four wheels, but they have those on the two front wheels and you can see that there s really, the suspension which is going to make it easier to push around. So this is not an all-terrain stroller, you may want to get an all-terrain stroller in addition to this stroller, but in terms of a small stroller, pushes really well. This stroller does a really great job. Again, nice, nice good sized basket that you can access that holds up to about a little bit over 40 pounds of stuff that you can put in it. Easy brake on the bottom, little red brake, up and down. The BABYZEN YOYO2 is awesome, it s great, I love those upgrades. It may be the right stroller for you, it may not be, but I do a video of my favorite travel strollers, which you can watch right now."

Babyzen YOYO2 Stroller,Babyzen YOYO2 Stroller Micro Lightweight Travel Strollers Best Strollers 2023 Magic Beans,"Eli is back, with the Babyzen YOYO2 stroller! In this video, Eli shares his thoughts regarding compact strollers and exactly why the ...",JAfXjAPdJrg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAfXjAPdJrg,84017,349,2023-07-02T10:00:23Z,I m excited about doing a full review of the babyzen yoyo 2 the zero plus the six plus and talking all about the different ways that you can use your babies and yo-yo too but despite the fact that I ve done lots of reviews of this product I ve never done it in this way and here s why I ve been working with lots of customers in our stores and virtually and something that is just has really shifted in buying strollers is the concept of buying a baby Zen yo-yo a lightweight quote-unquote travel stroller from birth so here s the concept so a lot of people think that they should get like this fully functioning big giant stroller from the beginning but the reality is that I might recommend that you get a baby Zen yoyo with the zero plus configuration from the beginning and this is the product that you will literally walk out of the hospital with because you can use it with an infant car seat you can see with this wonderful zero plus pack you could have the baby lie perfectly flat from newborn and then add as the child gets bigger you turn it into a six plus variety which I ll show you in a couple minutes and you have this as an amazing travel stroller so oh and if you don t know me I m Ellie from Imagine being s videos I review and compare baby gear on YouTube we have the most comprehensive reviews on all of YouTube so definitely don t forget to subscribe to imagine means videos because we publish videos every week and I m going to help you figure out what stroller to get like maybe the babies I know you so like I said this is the yo-yo in the zero plus pack variety and what you see here is it has this nice sort of like bunting cocoon that you have attached to it um if you re wondering what color this is this is the gorgeous new for 2023 Stone gray color in the winter or if you re like in cooler climates what you ll do is you ll add this nice sort of like warm you can see this sort of like um sort of like fuzzy um warm um texture to the back of this product and then it s just velcro that away but in the meantime what you ll do is you have this nice soft pack but not too soft because the baby s knuckle neck muscles are developing and you can have your baby lie flat we want our babies lying perfectly flat when they are first born and having your baby lying in this flat situation is just a great way to take around your baby versus having your baby will go around in an infant car seat sort of all day long um there is a little sort of like a sun visor here which you can pop in and out um little newborn head support really it s so comfortable for baby and a really nice Buckle to keep them safe and secure in the newborn pack but the cool thing is that if you want to go back and forth from newborn to infant car seat you can do that let me show you how to do it so let me show you how to attach the infant car seat adapters and how to attach a car seat I m going to use the light um you may have the new paperlight RX or new paper RX all of those seats work great with the yoyo so you have these little adapters here and let me just show you how to I ll just put the brake on how to put them on so it can be a little tricky now it slides on it ll do the same thing on the other side just go to the bottom and slide it up you only have to do that once you can keep these on forever it s not a big deal now you have these two pieces now the best thing to do is so you can see the attach right to the bottom here but the best thing to do is to take these and actually attach them to the car seat in the studio I have a Nuna Pippa light so I ll use that as an example what you do is you unsnap here unsnap here and then what you want to do is you also want to remove this you just like flip this up flip this down cool so this is nice and flat cool nice and flat position and now what you can do is take your infant car seat and click it right on now the cool thing is that you saw like I had to like click click you don t all you have to do is push these buttons and keep these parts of the after attached to the infant car seat and you can even put this right into the base it s perfectly safe to do so with having these things sort of like flapping around the sides it has no impact on safety whatsoever but the cool thing is now that these are attached to your Peppa so all you have to do is like line it up right here and you click just like that and it clicks it also on this side just like that so it s right on and now you can have your go back and forth from using the infant car seat to the zero plus pack to remove the infant car seat from the adapters eventually again what you want to do is just push right here and push right here to remove but you just push this button right here let me just remove that it s so easy to remove that and remove that nice So eventually you ll want to do is what you ll want to do is change this from the zero plus to the six plus pack um and let me just quickly do that for you so again you re only going to do this once the reality is you re only going to put the adapters on ones you re only or maybe you ll have multiple children you ll do this but this is not something you do every day but it is just something that you will eventually do so what you have to do is it s very simple there s these two velcro sort of velcro tabs you just unvelcro on velcro right here unclip unclip right here unclip and clip right here and then what you just pull out the whole thing and now you are back to just the basic frame again you may want to use this with that pipa just as a frame I mean I would this for me I might do that if you don t want to have the zero plus just use the frame with no seed and click your infant car seat in and out especially if you have another stroller with a bassinet and this is really just for travel that is a great thing to do um it s also super super light and easy to fold in this position so what you do is you just fold this underneath like this Fold It Down and you can see it s like super super small so this is just like a really nice small thing I ll fold this again a little bit later in the video but that is uh just something that you want to consider just using this just as a normal travel frame so when you go from the zero plus to the six plus what you want to do is you want to remove this sort of like the plastic backing and there s a little white tab here if you have an older yoyo it may be red just pull that out pull that out slip this out okay and now you ll put it back onto the frame by again lining it up and pushing in this little white tab boom click and you re back back in business so now you re going to set up for the six plus pack here is the six plus seat and you ll see back here on the back there is a pocket right here there s a pocket pocket pocket pocket and you just slide the seat onto the pocket now this is attached to the back of the frame you clip right here clip right here and then take this little velcro piece velcro around Velcro velcro are you in your living room right now putting together your yoyo with me are we spending time together how s parenting going have you had a baby yet I hope it s going great okay this is attached up here just take this through pop it through Velcro send this around there s a little Buckle here I don t think the Buckle is the wrong word it s a little I don t know little facet or what have you to put it through the velcro there right nice and secure put this through here nice cool so this is the seat now we have to add a color pack so what happens is you ll have these wires for the canopy here is the color pack let s see what s in the cattle pack it s the stone color again I m excited about the stone color it s like it s like a silver it s kind of like has a silver energy to it if you like that type of a color there it goes they re little velcro pieces on the back and velcro pieces to match up over here and then what you ll do is you ll unbuckle this really nice chunky Buckle I really like the buckle it s like weird to like buckles but it really is like after as you re researching baby gear take a look at the Buckle because the Buckle the wheels those are like the signs that you re going to get some that s quality that s built to last and I definitely feel like this is one of those things so you ll take the shoulder straps pop it through one of these slits I chose the second slit because it s I just did and put this one here too put this through great pull that through done pulled it through great that s in and then what you ll do is you ll take the little um the actual Buckle put that through and now what you re going to do is you are these pieces are on the side that come up to the side great cool and now what you ll do is there s a little sort of like toggly thing on the bottom what you ll do is you ll reach underneath and it ll like toggle it there s a little catch right underneath the nice thing is if you live in the Greater Boston area we ll assemble the strollers for you free so just so you know you don t have to do this like bring in pieces of Yoyo and like zero plus move to six plus please do this for us we re happy to help you that s what you do um so um so that is the seed look how the nice that the seed pack looks on the seat but where is the canopy again here are the canopies I showed you before it says six plus so these are the six plus wires there is a small one and a big one on the back here well there s a pocket on the back of the canopy people love this all right our e-commerce manager has a yoyo and she with her child and she thinks that that little pocket on the back of the canopy is one of the coolest one of the best features it s like a surprising feature of the yoyo so you just put on this little wire on the back here and then you take the front one find that loop on the front side and loop that through great and it comes to the other side great and now what you re going to do is on the top here of The Handlebar there s a place to put a insert a wire and there s one right here as well and that s that will line up with the canopy perfectly let s put the back one on and loop that on and then put the front one on there s also like another loop to go with it so Loop okay these are all looped on put this back on behind here velcro Velcro all right here is the review part of the video um so we now have this all set up in the six plus variety again in the beautiful stone color like I said before you have the little zipper for the pocket in the back a little peekaboo window on the top um a sort of a I call this a visor to come in and out but it s six plus and it s really easy to adjust by just pulling this little adjuster on the back there s even a pocket here for your stuff a mesh pack on the back for more stuff lower it down what they have your uh when your child wants to take a nap and then just pull those two loops on the side to lift it back up to fold down the yoyo there are these two little buttons on the side you fold under and then underneath here there s a button and a pull pushing the button pull the little red sort of pull grab the little Chrome handle and this is small enough to go in the overhead compartment of an airplane which people love you can see that has this really great suspension very very high quality wheels and it just holds out so small to open it back up you just open up the handlebar like that and you just open up just like a yoyo and it holds up to 50 pounds so it could really last a really really long time so whether you re buying this from newborn with an infant car seat zero pack you can get a bassinet with it you can add a ride on board to turn this to a double stroller you can add a connect second piece to turn this into a true double stroller you can add a parasol a foot muff really any season whether it s the summer or the winter and so so many different varieties so though you may get a big stroller to go with this this stroller can really be the one stroller that you use for many many stages of your family s Journey oh so if you are interested in seeing a video of the connector into a double stroller or any other videos of the yoyo and some comparisons I m going to put a link in the description below to watch some more videos and you can learn way more about the baby s anyway too it s an awesome stroller and there s a really good reason why it is so popular and I will see you at another video Music thank you

strollers to Disney yes 12 strollers with my three kids and in this video I m going to be sharing about the best Disney strollers from Singles to doubles whether you can bring wagons and Rider boards we re going to cover it all so keep Music watching if you re new here I m Emily I m the Stoller Mom I m a mom of three kids ages four and under and what makes my Channel Unique is I actually use the products with my three kids and give honest review from a mom s perspective if you haven t already be sure to subscribe to my channel it helps out so much and don t forget to like comment below with any questions and Shop through the links below cuz I do have a few discount codes for these strollers now before I jump into single strollers I do want to mention that I m going to cover a lot from Singles to doubles to wagons and more so be sure to check out the timestamps below if there s a specific section you re looking for the good news about single strollers is they are all approved at Disney so you don t have to worry about whether your stroller is approved like you do with wagons and doubles however there are certain things that make a single stroller better for Disney versus others now I will say I saw every stroller Under the Sun at Disney all different kinds of Brands so there are a lot of options to choose from but some things that make a really good Disney stroller are things like a good basket for storage a good canopy and a nice seat for those naps in the afternoon and one of those strollers that s really great for Disney and great for those of you with older kids is the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 this stroller can hold up to 65 PBS making it great for your older kids as well as has a good seatback and a really good recline for naps on the go I love how the footrest adjust best and comes up making it great for your child s naps my three-year-old who s 998th percentile had a great nap in this stroller it has a good canopy while the basket leaves a little to be desired you see these strollers all over Disney and with good reason you also can rent them which I ll talk about here in just a little bit but this is a great option for those of you with older kids another good single option that s good for those of you with little kids is the Mocking Bird single to double this is a great fullsize stroller it s actually the stroller I had when I had my first baby you can get a bassinet there s tons of accessories including an infant insert which is great and this stroller has an amazing basket holding 25 lbs I do have a code for this stroller as well that gets you a parent cup holder so check that out below but it gives you a lot of Versatility while still having a great canopy things like snack trays and is a really good option for Disney now let s say you don t want to do a fullsize stroll and you re looking for something more of a travel stroller something that s going to be great for your flight there and when you re at the parks well two really good options and they re both affordable are the Bombi BB V2 this stroller gives an amazing fold has a great canopy a good basket and a good push for a travel stroller we took this one all around Disney and I loved it I thought my baby was comfortable and it was great now I did wish there was a little bit of ventilation in the back of the seat when they were trying to take naps but I do have a full post on stroller fans so check that out below I do have one that s a misting fan and that one definitely helped and I also have a coupon code for this one where you can get a snack tray so check that out below as well now the biggest downside on the bombie is that is 18 lbs so if you want a lightweight stroller that you can just throw over your shoulder you may want to look at the Zoe tour the Zoe tour has a great canopy it also has a nice basket and a really easy fold it just folds right in half and it s very lightweight weighing only 13.2 lbs I love the snack tray and the accessories that Zoe has with their strollers and I have a 15 off code so check that out below so now that we ve talked about singles let s talk about double strollers because there are more limitations when it comes to double strollers at Disney but thankfully nowadays most sidebyside strollers are Disney approved they re under that 31 in wide and 52 in long so pretty much every side by-side double stroller you re going to be able to take the Disney but here are some options that I think are really good and I ll kind of break them out by each category now a really great double stroller option especially for those of you with older kids is the Bob double it is great for naps on the go has an amazing canopy and a really nice push and something that I found because Bobs are all over Disney is they have like a lower foot rest for your child that your older kids can also sit and rest their legs on now I m sure Bob does not recommend this so keep that in mind but I did talk to several parents who used that feature at Disney and they loved it now the story doesn t have the biggest storage so keep that in mind in getting a good parent organizer and I will say if you re having to take the transportation especially at Disney World keep in mind that the Bob does have a pretty big fold so just something to know another option that I was so excited and loved having at Disney was the menu Duo this stroller is brand new so I didn t have the snack Trace but hopefully when you buy it it will have the snack Trace so I ll link them below but this stroller offers a newborn ready recline which makes it great for your little ones at Disney not many side by sides offer this and so it s better than keeping your baby in a car seat being able to have that newborn ready recline is great for your baby on the go but also those of you who have older kids my four and a half-year-old who never naps in the stroller was able to lay down on this and some things that Uppa baby did really nicely that make it a great Disney stroller is they actually have like a mesh panel behind the seat that you can open for added air flow during naps they also have a place where you can put an air tag in the basket making it easier to find your stroller which I m actually making a video on because if you have a black stroller at Disney being able to identify your stroller is really important so check that out below now if you are going to be flying with the menu Duo I do recommend buying a travel bag and up a baby actually sells one with a warranty I know it is more money but it is worth the money to protect your stroller because Airlines do not take care of your stroller so I ll link another option below if you are taking a different double stroller and want that option but something to keep in mind and if you are flying to Disney and you want the best stroller for your trip to Disney you may want to look at the silvercross jet double this stroller is Compact and made for air travel it offers really plush padded seats and it s still going to do a great job at Disney with its nice basket make sure you get a parent organizer I ll link my favorite one below but this stroller is going to give you a lot of space and it s very lightweight under 20 lbs next this wouldn t be a best Disney stroller if we didn t talk about the Zoe twin the Zoe Trio and the Zoe quad now because wagons are not allowed at Disney the Zoe strollers allow you to transport more than one kid around the park at Disney they are approved and they make it so nice plus I m pretty sure the Zoe twin has one of the best baskets for Disney it s just nice and deep while it only holds 10 PBS I was able to load this basket up I also love the canopy and Zoe kills it in the accessories for Disney they have side bags you can add straps that make it easier to carry on Transportation now don t get me wrong when you re pushing the trio or the quad it s like pushing a boat but being able to transport multiple kids around Disney without having multiple strollers is so nice we used the trio with my three girls on our last day and it was a really good option oh and I have a 15 off code so check that out below I will say if you re going to use this for every day and you want to elevate your push I do think the allterrain wheels are worth it but it does make the stroller a little bit heavier now let s say you re looking for a stroller for one child and then the option for your other one to rest their legs well the juvie Caboose is a great option that is Affordable they have a few different options depending on features you re looking for but it also allows you to have a second child CL CL on and off as they need their legs rested and it is approved at Disney now let s talk about what things are not allowed at Disney there is a lot of debate on whether Rider boards are allowed at Disney and whether wagons are allowed at Disney in fact when I was there last week there were so many wagons now wagons are allowed at Disney when used for medical purposes so you will see a tag on many wagons that will say this however Disney was being very nice when I was there and I heard several people were allowed to bring it but only one time it was a one-time exception for some reason Disney does not allow wagons and I don t exactly know why I ve heard different things but it s something to keep in mind if you do not have a medical exemption for bringing your wagon you should not bring it because I also have Instagram DMS that say parents were forced to walk all the way back to their Airbnb 20 minutes or all the way back to the car which the parking is often not near the entrance to the park to store their wagon because Disney would not allow it so it really is at the discretion of the employee you re talking to and so one of the strollers I just me mentioned or renting a stroller is definitely going to be a better option than bringing your wagon when it comes to Rider board there s some debate according to Baby list they say in 2023 Rider boards were now allowed I saw them all over Disney but if you look on their website they say any trailer like object is not allowed at Disney what I will say is this one s a little bit more worth the risk for me and if you know if you re local to Disney and you have some insight please comment below and I ll pin it to the top but I think it s worth the risk because you can put it in your basket if you need to they re not as big and bulky and it could be a really great option for your older kids who need to rest their legs so if any of you have any insight on this let me know below all right so I just went over some great Disney strollers do you rent a Disney stroller do you rent from a third party company or do you buy your own honestly that s going to be different for every family now something I will say if you re looking at renting a stroller from the Disney parks I did rent one to try out and I would not recommend it the canopy is not good there s no seat recline no storage and it s honestly not a great push plus it s kind of expensive and I will say while I was there they actually ran out of doubles so if Dad was standing in in front of me with two little kids and he was not able to get he had to get two single strollers so just something to keep in mind I think a better option would be to rent through a third party which I actually have a blog post down below they have strollers like Baby Jogger Bob and juvie like the ones I just mentioned today you can also even rent like a Zoe Trio or quad and it ends up being almost the same price if not less than if you were renting from Disney and they deliver it right to your hotel or your Airbnb I hope this video was helpful let me know what questions you have below and don t forget to shop through the links below because I do have a lot of discount codes and I ll be sure to link my best Disney stroller fans parent organizers

if you are then you may want to consider the silvercross jet 5 this is the latest version of the silvercross jet it works from newborn it works with an infant car seat and it fits in the overhead compartment of an airplane and in this video I m excited about showing you a full review so this is the jet 5 the latest I guess the fifth iteration of the Jet and they did an absolutely spectacular job um I m very very impressed um you can see that there is this five panel canopy so really good sun protection I m just looking for the top down um but the thing about this is they made the stroller like a little bit wider and a little bit taller so even though this is totally cabin friendly fits in the overhead cabar of airplane will fit um perfectly in your trunk as I ll show you in a couple minutes um but they it really could be a stroller from newborn as well they also have larger Wheels um let s just go through some of the basic features of this stroller um to recline the stroller you just pull this down it goes down all the way this is actually a full live flat for newborn so what you do is you re going to lift up the little leg the calf support here again so your baby is really comfortable when they are lying flat and then what you re going to do is underneath here this is something that people miss a lot of the time but it s really important underneath the calf support there s a little velcro piece and then there is this um sort of newborn catch there s a little snap on the back of the frame snap here snap here and now your infant is going to be totally safe and secure so you could literally walk out of the hospital with your newborn baby right in the jet while I m down here there s a nice structured seat nice cushioning comfortable for baby but let s fold down the stroller so to fold down the stroller here s what you do you just grab the little silver cross logo here push that down put it against your hip and then you just pull this towards you click and now another nice thing about this is you can just just sort of trolley this along so if you have your baby or your infant car seat or whatever what have you this just pulls right along and to put this in the overhead compartment of an airplane all you do is there these two little buttons here you should have just tuck these in and it is like super super small look how small that is it s only 15.7 lbs so it s really light as well and then what you ll do is you ll just pop it back in and then what you can do is you re just going to um unlatch it on the side there s a little latch on the right here un latch and then you just flick it back up make sure that s closed and now you are good to go perfect um another thing about this is that in terms of newborn comp compatibility is that it works with an infant car seat let me show you I m going to have a Nuna pipa air RX today in my example um so what you re going to do is you re just going to remove um the belly bar again just remove it when you get your infant car seat um you re going to see there are two infant car seat adapters and there s this crossbar um this crossbar is for previous versions of the jet that there and you can see how the previous versions were more narrow and also you couldn t fold it with the adapters attached but with a new jet you can um fold it with the adapters attached so what you do is you just pop one in like this click pop the second one in like this perfect um it s just very well put together I just you know i I ve been I ve I ve I ve reviewed like thousands of strollers or hundreds of strollers over a thousand strollers um and when um something that you can really tell from sort of like better crafts crafts person ship for the strollers is when all the sort of the attachments attach perfectly worked really really nicely and now what you re going to do is you re just going to grab your Pippa or other compatible um silvercross products clicks right on so now you can go about your day and also I ll just say that I have this sort of grav surface it pushes really nice nicely despite the fact that there s gravel so even though this is a lightweight travel stroller um if you re pushing your you know baby across through a playground or through a grally area down your driveway this is going to push really really nicely to remove the pipa what you ll do is you ll just push these two buttons remove put it to the side and then to remove the car seat adapters you just push right here and you push right here and then I m going to raise up the seat again um this is one of the highest um seat Heights of any like really of any stroller um it goes really really high sometimes parents complain that their babies are kind of slouching in the stroller but the nice thing about this is you can see they re really high so they can see the world really nicely so just to simulate a little bit of real life um let s put the jet 5 in your trunk so you re there with your kid you re going to pull go up to your trunk you re going to put on your brake and then all you re going to do is you ll put the infant car seat or the child into their car seat and then you run behind here you push down you look towards you and you can see if it s like really beautifully in your trunk to make more space what you re going to do is you re going to open this up and you can see it fits a tiny just really really tiny in the trunk of your car flip-flop friendly brake gred on green off depending how you see it and also um this really great magnetic Buckle so it s easy for you to put your child in the U in the stroller so all you have to do is it s really cool it s actually sort of fun magnets together and then magnets together and this really nice sort of chrome detailing around the Buckle as well and I will pop in the belly bar as well and the the other thing about the jet 5 is there s a snack tray let me show you so so cute there is a new snack tray for the child but it comes with these really beautiful little silicon accessories so all you do is you grab your snack tray you pop it on the front here so now your kit can sit you don t have to put the inserts in but you can what you ll do is you ll just open it up and you just pop in this little cute little accessory and here s a little sippy cup pop that in and you re good to go on your way another thing about the jet 5

Silver Cross Jet Stroller,Silver Cross Jet 2020 Stroller Full Review Magic Beans Best Lightweight Travel Stroller,"Traveling with a stroller just got easier! In this Magic Beans stroller review video, Eli introduces the brand new Silver Cross Jet ...",aLPPU0ASH2Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLPPU0ASH2Q,66135,214,2020-02-01T13:00:03Z,"The Silver Cross Jet for 2020 has 62 different upgrades, which makes this essentially a brand new stroller. It is great for travel, works from newborn without any accessories. If you have any questions, if you want personalized recommendations for you and for your family, you should send me an email to questions mbeans.com. Give me a call at 617-383-8259, or just leave a comment below. I ve traveled with my own three kids many times. I know that traveling can be a very stressful. You have to pack the car and get ready for the airplane and how are you going to do this without the right piece of gear? The Silver Cross Jet may be the stroller for you. So I m excited about showing you the Jet today. Here s the review. Here is the Silver Cross Jet for 2020, really excited about the upgrades that they did. So people been asking in 2019, Hey Eli. What s the deal? You haven t done any reviews of the Jet, or very few reviews of the Jet. The V1 of the Jet was not really up to my standards, but I m so excited. Silver Cross took our feedback, literally took our feedback, and there are 62 different upgrades to the 2020. Just- let s do this as a V2 Jet. So this is a great travel stroller, mini micro stroller that fits in the overhead compartment of an airplane. The first version was a little bit shaky and this one, they definitely stabilized it in the upgrades. It is flexible by design. The nice thing about having a stroller that s more flexible is that it s actually- nothing is going to break, it ll stay really solidly together, despite the fact that it s a little bit flexible by nature. But they have a wider wheel base, taller handle bar, and the fabrics that they do use are just really, really super-premium, super-lovely, and just a really beautiful-looking stroller. But let me show you how this thing works. You should know that it has a full recline for newborns, so all you have to do is pull this little button on the back and pull this little spring down, and there you go. You can put your baby straight into the Jet, right from newborn, and also you can get car seat adapters, so you can use it with a Maxi Cosi compatible car seat like all the other strollers, the Nuna PIPA, a Cybex, etc etera. So that s really nice. And they ve increased the weight limit of the 2020 Jet to 55 pounds That s a big baby! So that basically, to the end of strollerhood, you can use that with the Jet. Little peek-a-boo window on the top with a little magnetic closure. Nice leather handle bar and they also have a improved sun visor. But let me show you how this thing folds down cuz that s a very nice fold. So what you do is you just lift right here with your foot, right there on the bottom, and then at the at the handle, there s this beautiful little Silver Cross detailing. There are two buttons you pull and you push that down and then what I just do is lean this against my hip. You just pull this toward you. That s it really easy, so you can do that. With one hand, it automatically latches closed and the belly bar, very genius, really doubles as a sort of a carry handle and it comes with a a protective cover included when you purchase the stroller, which is quite nice. You just remove the handle bar to make it smaller. To make this go into the overhead compartment of an airplane, you just sort of push on the inside and this removes, you do that on both sides and it removes, great. To open the stroller back up, just lift right here first and then there s a little latch on the side. Open this up and then the final move is you just squeeze right here. That s perfectly open and then actually, this is the real final move, you just make sure that the little locking mechanism is in the down position and now you are ready to go. The Silver Cross Jet is one of my favorite travel strollers and I actually do a full roundup of my favorite travel strollers which you can see right now."

Doona Infant Car Seat Stroller Stroller,Expert Parent Review Doona Car Seat Stroller by Pediatrician and OBGYN Parents,What is something we got for baby number 2 that we didn t have for baby number 1? -- The Doona Car Seat Stroller! This week ...,ZKxhFeKPiO0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKxhFeKPiO0,57133,517,2023-08-02T13:00:23Z,hello this week we are going to review something that we got for baby number two that we didn t have for baby number one and we have loved this time around so true this is the Duna car seat and stroller yep and just in case it s your first time meeting us I m Kurt I m a board certified pediatrician Pediatric Cardiologist dad to a toddler and a four-month-old I m Sarah I am a board certified OBGYN fertility specialist and have been a stay atome mom for the last four months so I have some tricks for wrangling two under two we re going to talk about that right after this again if it s your first time meeting us I m Kurt I m Sarah and we are the doctors Music sporman so this is something I get asked about almost every time we are out and about yep and that is how do you like your Duna yeah so we did not have a Duna stroller for our first baby I thought it was unnecessary very ensive um and CE our daughter quickly made it known that she hated her car seat um and so any extra time in a car seat structure was going to be a no for that kid yeah she absolutely just didn t like it no um and so we quickly kind of switched her to conable car seat kind of as early as she could fit safely in that brand we got um and you can actually check out our review for that um in a previous video we ve done yep so after having baby number two I was trying to figure out how I could get out of the house with this little tiny baby um and an almost 2-year-old toddler um and my sanity still working on the sanity part but the rest we can almost manage sometimes um but what I found was that carrying an infant car seat on my arm while trying to Wrangle a toddler like that s darting about in a parking lot safely um was really really tough um and our infant car seat was very very light but it s bulky sometimes the toddler wanted to be carried or again it s trying to run into traffic um and so I wanted to see if there was some helpful option out there um we had been looking at the Duna and thinking about it and finally said let s let s try it yeah so now in case you ve never heard of the Duna it is a car seat SL stroller combo and per the website quote Duna is the world s first complete and fully integrated travel system allowing you to move from car seat to stroller in seconds the Innovative design allows you to navigate the streets at ease without disturbing your sleeping child when hopping in a car traveling by bus or walking up the stairs the Revolutionary car seat and stroller provides a safe and practical solution for parents on the go now just to say we are not sponsored by J they didn t even give us a car seat to try for free we paid for this one full stick of price we didn t actually but we ll also get to that okay great but need to say that sounds very intriguing and promising right um and then I had this trip coming up where we had to travel on a plane so I thought this all sounded like a good idea and could justify this purchase um because this could be turned into a car seat where you don t have to have the base um and also turned into a stroller so great for travel we just decided to purchase one um which leads me to my first tip um the Duna is very expensive it retails new for 550 if you get this midnight Edition um AKA all black it s 650 um did we get Midnight in black no no wonderful so that was all more than we wanted to spend on extra baby gear especially like we have a car seat we have a stroller um so my tip here is I found a gently used one on Facebook Marketplace um and you can really find them on Marketplace kind of from anywhere between 280 and 350 so not cheap but like significantly more affordable now the recommendation on reusing infant car seats is to make sure they are not expired car seats do have an expiration date you can check those um for instance we actually just sold one of the car seats we bought new to someone else and it had a sevene lifespan so they get five years out of um which is great but check the date check the expiration date um usually printed on the car seat itself yep um and the other biggest thing is the weight range too all car seats have like a weight range um in which time they will outgrow them and so again making sure that is like within the weight of your baby that your baby is safely positioned and then of course there isn t any like massive damage to it like making sure all the straps are intact and there hasn t been any damage to car SE from a prior potential accident yeah the nice thing about the Duna is that I think the outgrow weight they recommend is 35 PBS we ll talk about that in a little bit but babies outgrow them generally before they are expiring so it is possible again to find a safe gently used Duna because the kids outgrow them before they expire um which is a pleasant surprised to me to find out that we paid half price for ours cuz we have loved it and we are most certainly um using ours a lot because our toddler loves to push it around she also likes to be carried which is nice because you can hold your toddler in one arm and push the Duna with the other yes so let s talk about the stroller itself and some of the specifications and other safety considerations so the Duna is pretty neat because with one motion it takes only about a few times to figure this out it morphs from car seat into stroller in seconds and we can show that um has a fiveo harness which is standard for most car seats and an adjustable handar that can act as an anti- rebound bar inside the car which we ll show you um it also has a foot brake sun shade and pretty sturdy Wheels um we use it off-road occasionally across the park or down some Trails um but does great sidewalks parking lots Etc yep all of the cloth that s on the car seat is removable and washable it does come with an infant insert um and a head support um and important to know this car seat is always rear facing um and again website says it is suitable for in infants up to 35 lb and 32 in tall our toddler who is 2 and 35 lb is definitely too big for this car seat she does like to get in and stroll around when her brother s being carried in a wrap and we have the duner around but definitely is not a forever car seated is not going to give you the longevity that a convertible will but we have loved it for this in stage right so other important things about this it s TUV and FAA aircraft approved for travel um and has a two years man manufacturers warranty um so it has also has this dual functionality as a stroller and a car seat and so it s been tested to meet both the US and European standards for car seats and strollers and handheld carriers so it has passed the most rigorous safety tests it is a safe car seat as well yeah something else we ve loved about the dut is we found the install of the base it s really easy um and you can use it without a base also so like if we re like putting it in the vehicle that we drive often it just clicks in clicks out but if like say for instance someone else like if the opposite one of us has to pick them up from someplace on the way home you can just strap any car it like belts in with the seat back belt um a little more cumbersome of a system just like getting around the wheels for the the shoulder strap is a little tricky but doable in a pinch very easy like even if you were traveling using Uber this is a great option yeah totally the thing about this one though is you might not be throwing this car seat around too much it weighs 17 lbs um so once you put a baby in this car seed it is not light yep it s like it is definitely like more cumbersome like and we were coming from like we had the lightest car seat on the market before this we went from about five pound car seat to something literally three times as heavy um which was quite something and then you know you throw our baby in there we ve got 30 lb and it s just a little unwieldy um for me it s like this is not easy for Sarah her like Calves are bruised up from bumping into her leg um and so just like is a little bit different but we have still think it s worth it so far so with all of that let s talk a little bit about what we love about it things we don t love so much and if we would buy it again yeah so I love that it is easy I don t have to like take the baby out of a car seat to put in a stroller or if he falls asleep in the car I don t have to you know you just literally just pick a car seat up drop the wheels down and you are ready to go um and that is super convenient it s nice and outw this sleeping baby or have to do any kind of transferring um I also really do feel a lot safer um with him in this ready to go cuz basically I can take him out of the car drop the wheels roll him around lock him there while I get his sister out of the car and then I have her hang onto the car seat with me onto the stroller and we push him together into wherever we re going or to the park or to whatever and she feels contained and safe and I m not trying to like carry a car seat and carry her or hold her hand um it s just it is really convenient and it makes a transition from car to like out of the car that much quicker fast especially when You got a temperamental 2-year-old that and this little tiny baby that can t hold his head up you know it s not like you re just popping a tiny infant out and put him on your hip and off you go like he was so little and so fragile and so it was just it was it s easy it s really easy yep it is so easy just in the car out of the car and just bam he s in a contained stroller you re ready to go yep and the other thing I like is if we ever had to travel you could take it on an airplane you could put it in a taxi we wouldn t have to take a separate stroller it is it is pretty convenient um but with that what are the things we don t like about it so the thing I hate which isn t as much of an issue for Kurt is that it is heavy it weighs 17 PBS and then you throw my 15b baby in it and it is a big lift to get it up into our vehicle um the solution here is to kind of just roll it as much as possible like don t carry it around drop the wheels push it wherever you need to go then only time you re really lifting it is when you re putting it into the car um the biggest downside to this car seat is that it s heavy if we didn t have like 10 stairs to get in and out of our house it might be less um of a burden but is heavy I m saying now their disadvantage to this just like in terms of having a stroller is that it doesn t have any storage in it there are accessories you can buy like a clipon bagg um or like putting things Clips on the handlebars Etc um both of these have to be removed to put it in the car there s no drink holder and things that like we really love about like our stroller we had for CE um and so like you do have that disadvantage because it is a convertible stroller to car seat you miss out on some of the kind of storage space you would have with something that is just a stroller yeah Kurt also hates that the sun shade like you pull the sun shade out you know over them and you it kind of hits the handlebar when you pull it over and it drives Kurt nuts he s like why isn t this just a little bit taller but it is very flexible and like gets through it but 38 of an inch would make all the difference in terms of the handle but he still he loves the thing yeah yeah um which comes down to the like would we make the investment again which I just learned we paid half price awesome if you can do that by all means like save your dollars where you can like our gently use Duna is is great to me is it would have been had it been brand new yes and so for that absolutely we would buy it for number two again um especially given that we have a todler that we re also trying to Wrangle yeah it s made it possible for me to feel like more comfortable getting out of the house with both kids and feel safer about it I still probably would say you don t need it for baby number one um or you know again there s just no storage and no whatever so with one kiddo and when it s much more doable to not yeah so one like other like little negative about it is like it is so easy to go from the car seat to in the stroller mode that like it s tempting to just leave him in it a lot and that s something that we consciously just have to make mental notes so like hey we have to get out here like baby development means that they re on a clean mat on the ground playing they re working on their core strength like not always being in the container um it is not a safe place to sleep um and so like not a place to just leave them to sleep like of course like while you re traveling if they fall asleep while you re pushing around being observed it s fine but like safe sleep again is not in a car seat correct y so it s it s very easy to just you know leave them in his little bucket whereas you know our first didn t love her car seat at all so we never had to wor about so she like we got home like how can we get her out of the car seat faster so then she would be happier so anyway that s the Duna we overall really love it would get it again it s safe shared all the specs with you here if you have any my biggest wreck is find one used um and do some weightlifting to get ready to Lug it around um if you have any questions please leave them below otherwise we ll see you next week bye guys we

Doona Infant Car Seat Stroller Stroller,Doona Infant Car Seat Stroller Review,The Doona could be a good choice for you if you are looking for a car seat for infant that can do double duty as a stroller.,vqb8IQdCvLw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqb8IQdCvLw,111954,1007,2023-04-04T15:34:27Z,three things we love about the Duna it s an infant car seat and stroller in one making traveling with a baby easier and more convenient the handle serves as an anti-rebound bar an added safety feature and it has European seat belt routing for baseless mode
Doona Infant Car Seat Stroller Stroller,Doona vs Evenflo DualRide Car Seat Review,Doona and Evenflo DualRide are the only two seats on the market with the unique feature of an infant seat and stroller in one.,AKH-ocaQE9M,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKH-ocaQE9M,208373,2726,2023-03-12T13:00:11Z,let s dive into the similarities and differences between the Dual ride and the Duna and how to decide which one is right for you Music Music so the most obvious similarity is that they are both stroller to car seat combination type seats the other thing that is relatively similar between the two is their size so if you think about the footprint the amount of space they re going to take up front to back in the vehicle seat they both are relatively the same in terms of how much depth they take up so that s not really a factor to decide width-wise same thing they both are right around 18 inches so not your best option necessarily for putting seats side by side but not a reason to choose one over the other we really like that they both have anti-rebound bar features on the Dual ride the anti-rebound bar is on the base itself so when you re installing with the base that back panel serves as an anti-rebound bar and on the do not the stroller handle serves as the anti-rebound bar the other similarity between the two and this one I m a little bit sad about to be honest is that you still have to lock the vehicle s seat belt when using the vehicle seat belt installation method on both of them meaning neither have a built-in lock off they both have European belt path routing options as well no you don t have to use it just in Europe but it s a really great feature for being able to install the seats baseless that s kind of a broad brush overview of the similarities it s the differences where we really get into the nitty-gritty and is going to help you decide if one of these is better for you than the other arguably the biggest difference between the Dual ride and the Duna is the fact that the Dual ride can be a carrier you have to detach it from the wheels though when it s installed in the base so carrier mode might be helpful for you if you re running a quick errand and you don t need the stroller functionality the Duna does not have this capability the wheels are always attached to the carrier portion oh and I also wanted to add that all models have this sensor safe technology Music also on the Dual ride is a lock strong arm which helps with a super simple seat belt installation let s talk now about the harnessing differences between the two seats and there are some really significant ones that I want you to pay super close attention to the first is newborn baby fit if you are expecting to have a baby that is on the smaller side or a premature baby then I really want you to listen up the harness height on these two seats is really different so while the Dual ride is promoting 3 to 35 pounds and the Duna promotes 4 to 35 pounds in terms of the weight limits of the seat the Dual ride is going to fit a small baby so much better from the get-go because of those harness Heights and just as a reminder harness height is where the shoulder straps are going to be in relation to your child s shoulder so when your kiddo is rear-facing we want those straps at or just below the shoulder that s not optional that s where it has to be to protect them in a car crash and for our babies without neck control critical for their breathing position in the Duna that lowest harness slot setting is really high for a premature size infant so that can be a risk for us if you buy this Duna and you re hoping to put a small small baby in it even a you know average sized baby you may have trouble getting the shoulder strap at or just below the shoulder whereas in the Dual ride no issue at all the shoulder strap height goes really low it s easily going to fit this three pound baby that it talks about being able to because we can get those straps in the proper position so pay close attention to that if for any reason you think your baby is going to be on the smaller side a couple of other things I want to highlight as it relates to harnessing on the duno we have what s called a re-thread harness so those shoulder straps that we re talking about you have to manually adjust them from one slot to the next whereas on the Dual ride you re going to pull the headrest up and down to change the strap position no big deal either way just something to be aware of if that s important to you please because of the fit up to 35 pounds which by the way you re not going to be carrying a three to four year old in this seat and that s on average when they hit 35 pounds what you re really going to be paying attention to is their head height in relation to the top of the shell of the car seat there s differences here between the two and that as well so you have to have at least one inch of space between the top of your child s head and the top of the shell of the car seat so in the Duna it s here just Under The Canopy in the Dual ride it s when you fully extend the headrest it s got to be one inch below the fully extended headrest as you can see the Dual rides headrest extends quite a bit more than the duna s shell so why you care is if you plan to really max out the use of these stroller car seat combination options the Dual ride is going to help you get a child in there for a longer period of time if you care about things like Buckle tongue holders I want to make sure you know about that too in the Dual ride you do have these Buckle tongue holder features which means when you re trying to buckle your baby in you ve got a specific slot to pop those crotch Buckles in so that it s out of the way for easy for easy harnessing you don t have that feature on the Duna that s kind of the highlight of what s happening in the seeds you also do have one crotch Buckle position in the Duna and two in the Dual ride so that can impact fit as well but it s really that harness strap height for your little babies that I want you to play Super close attention to when you re choosing between the two seats let s look now at the stroller differences so first up you can see that the handle on the Dual ride is a little bit taller than it is on the Duna the other features I want to bring your attention to are you have this optional storage bag here that comes on the Dual ride so that s pretty cool you cannot ride with this in the car obviously and you can also get this cup holder attachment also has to be removed when you go in the car the Duna doesn t have either of those accessory features and then check out the wheels as well the Duna does have a bit more significant wheelbase than does the Dual ride so something else to take a look at depending on the type of terrain that you will be using the stroller in I have wheeled both of these on grass on pavement on these pavers like all around and honestly I don t feel any difference in terms of Wheeling them as I said the Duna has a bit bigger wheels so you may have some more durability with them but overall the feel of them is largely the same now I want to show you how to collapse them they re both pretty similar and easy to do Music all right in terms of weight of the seats attached to the wheels um they re both really freaking heavy but the Dual ride is definitely probably three pounds heavier or so than the Duna is let me set those down so weight s not going to be a reason that you re likely going to choose one or over the other so if you know you want a stroller car seat combination how do you decide between the two here s how I would really narrow it down first up if you believe that you re likely to have a newborn baby that is on the smaller side than the Dual ride for sure is going to be the better option for you we can get that harness to fit exactly how it s supposed to with the Duna not going to work well on a smaller than average size baby and even an average size baby it could be questionable the other thing to think about is the Dual ride has that carrier capability where you can detach the carrier portion from the wheels you can t do that with the do not if that s important to you dual ride wins there too how long are the seats going to last now I want you to kind of use caution as you think about this for sure the Dual ride is going to last longer meaning your child can be in it for a longer period of time but you guys these these seats are heavy and then when you add you know a 15 20 plus pound kid inside these seats we re talking about really using your muscles to schlep this thing around so while this one will last you longer the Dune is still going to last you a really long time too but just something that might be important to you the final thing is looks do you prefer the way one looks over the other that s personal preference and it may be a deciding factor for you as always if you are working on figuring out what is the very best car seat for you I cannot recommend enough our car seat buying kits that helps you take into consideration all of these factors to choose the best seat

Bugaboo Ant Stroller,Bugaboo Ant 2019 Travel Stroller Full Review!,The Bugaboo Ant has been discontinued by Bugaboo and is no longer available at Magic Beans The long anticipated ...,snnSmmDDKIo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snnSmmDDKIo,171651,575,2019-06-03T08:00:05Z,"Okay so I have the brand-new Bugaboo Ant! We ve been waiting for a Bugaboo Ant. We ve been waiting for this small compact stroller from Bugaboo. logo music They have their Bee and it s a city stroller but we wanted something really small that will fit in the overhead compartment of an airplane. This fits in over fifty airlines! So many airlines and I m excited about showing it to you. So, here are the things you need to know. This is from newborn so when you use it with a Bugaboo Cocoon you can use it from newborn and the thing that s really cool about it, is that it goes in both directions. Let me show you how that works. The first thing you do is just put on the brake, okay, and what you do is you just push this down, push this in. Right in nice and compact like that and then you just fold it right over and then you just simply pull it right out. Just like that, turn it around, and set it back in. And it comes right back up, just like that. And now, your child can face you. It has three positions the lower, the middle, and the high. You may be getting this, you may already have an UPPAbaby Vista or a Bugaboo Fox or some other larger stroller or donkey maybe even and this may be a really good secondary stroller so the thing I like about this is when you have a travel stroller you very, very rarely have the baby facing you. And we all love looking at our babies, I know I m a father of three children. I love looking at my children when they re in the stroller. Let me show you how this turns back around. Push this down. Push this in. Really easy and then what you do is you just fold it right down. Like that. Pull it right out and it comes right back over. Cool. Pull the right back up and now you are ready to go. This has this beautiful pink melange canopy and they put a peekaboo window in their canopy. Thank you Bugaboo! Now they have a peekaboo window and it s also an extendable canopy. All you have to do is zip this open and now you have great sun protection with your baby. Let me show you how this folds. Again, what you do is you push this down, fold it in it, it folds in really easily. There not any levers or gadgets or anything. Just easily clicks in, there s this really snap solid click. You fold it right over and now what you do is you lift right here and this is one of the coolest parts of the stroller. It rolls! So if you re going through an airport or even if you re going from your house or your apartment into your car, you just like, roll it around. Super, super easy. When you re ready to fold it up, All you do, push this down and boom. Ready to go. This goes in the overhead compartment of the airplane. Do you have an away bag? I have those, those away luggage bags and this just reminds me of this nice hard shell. Really, really solid and one of the cool things about this as well is that, if you can see here, very, very smart engineering Bugaboo. They have this mesh little bag which takes a half of the basket. So what you can do is can put your stuff in here and you can still access your stuff. Toys, bottles, etc. right there. Access it right from the airplane. Let me show you how this opens back up. Lift this up, all the way and then it opens like that. And then just lift, boom. And you re good to go. Super high quality really, really solid stroller. More things to know about the Bugaboo Ant Number one, it has a fifty pound weight capacity! Lots of other strollers in that category have a forty pound weight capacity but this goes up to fifty pounds. Just you know, fifty pounds, about a five-year-old. Give or take, depending on the five-year-old and also this is car seat compatible. So, like I said before, you can use the Bugaboo Cocoon, with this to make it for newborn compatible but you could also add car seat adapters which work with a Nuna Pipa Lite. So another thing about the stroller that I absolutely love is is that umbrella strollers and small compact strollers typically have really, really minuscule basket. It s a complaint that we hear from customers all the time. This stroller has actually quite a large basket. Like I said before you have that mesh piece, that enables you to access it when you re in the overhead compartment of an airplane or when you have it folded down but what you can do is you just un-velcro this and now you have a, just a, giant basket to hold all of your stuff. Nice suspension in the front and on the back. You ll see that there are different sized wheels. There s those great, high quality wheels that Bugaboo is known for. They have six inch wheels on the back and five inch wheels on the front. Like give or take a centimeter or so. So the stroller is only about 500. It goes up from 500-ish. Prices change, just so we all know that, but... so it s not a thousand dollar Bugaboo stroller. You can get this at a fairly reasonable a price point. It s also customizable, as many Bugaboo products are. So these, this hard shell on the side? That can be changed out. Right now I have it in the metallic but there are other colors available as well and also we have this nice, like I said, pink melange canopy. You have other, different color canopies that you can customize, also different fabrics. This stroller is launching with five options which you can learn more about at mbeans.com. And there you have it the Bugaboo Ant by Bugaboo, available from us at mbeans.com. If you want to see more, just click the link below and you can see links to other Bugaboo strollers.

of ...",Znqfcbo_1cY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Znqfcbo_1cY,27719,161,2019-07-27T19:33:36Z,today we re going to be looking at the ant the new ultra compact travel stroller from Bugaboo the ant is already available in the US but in Europe we won t see a general release until September luckily though we got a hold of one it can thus give you an in-depth look before the rush of initial release happens in a little over a month so here it is are you spellbound yeah me too why for me it s those wide grand coloured hardshell suitcase wings on the rear frame every time I see them I m immediately reminded of the way the ant seemingly transforms into a suitcase and it s like I m six again looking at a transformer toy and marveling over how cleverly the truck features have been integrated into the toys robot form we ll talk more about the suitcase function or as I like to call it fake suitcase mode later but for now let s kick off this review with some stats the boo-boo-boo ant clocks in in just over seven kilos it folds down to 55 by 38 by 23 centimeters within cabin luggage limits of course as this was the point it can take up to 22 kilos in the seat and eight kilos combined between the regular shopping basket and the handy dandy magazine rack on the back note that the weight capacity of 22 kilos in the seat doesn t mean that the ant will actually comfortably accommodate the 22 kilo child a 22 kilo child is a five-year-old and space-wise the ant is going to seem a bit cramped for most children over the age of two as I said as far as the seat goes it s a bit on the small size but the trade-off for this is the ability to reverse its facing and in that reverse facing to fully recline a reversible seat is a nice thing especially when we re talking about using a stroller with younger kids they re cute and you want to see them all the time you also want to catch that falling pacifier before the launch sequence turns code red as far as the full recline goes it s a nice thought but the way it s executed on the ant relegates this functionality really only the children well under a year old whose arms and legs are still short enough not to dangle into space as a result of the missing footrest and the lack of encasing seat walls one note on the optimal age of children with which to use the ant who could move like many other travel stroller manufacturers offers a newborn option called cocoon but I would caution you against it for the same reasons I would call you against the newborn options of any travel stroller we support the neck of newborns because they re fragile right there s nothing on the planet that you would handle as carefully as a newborn baby and yet stroller companies continue to suggest that it s safe to put your baby in a soft bag way down below knee height and goes zipping around on an ultra light weight aluminum instruction with virtually no suspension and wheels barely larger than those found on a skateboard for me that s just reckless personally I wouldn t advocate using anything smaller than a full-size stroller with a newborn for travel get a baby carrier and if you somehow must use a travel stroller for a newborn then at least use a rigid option like a car seat with adaptors but know that this is still a substandard choice let s move on to parent comfort then and talk about folding at what point exactly did boo boo boo decide to eliminate minimalism from their list of important design principles everybody boo stroller pre Fox had three steps to fold one adjuster removes seat to slide down the telescopic handle three fold the chasis with the aunt read a minimum of five steps three just for the seat and that s being generous of course because the safety catches are set up such that each successive step cannot be completed if those preceding it have not been locked correctly this is not as easy as it sounds there are a lot of parts that all fold or slide collectively to complete each step and the textile seemed to continuously get in the way couple this with the ant s ultra lightweight three tube telescopic handle and you wind up with a symmetry nightmare one side slides but the other doesn t one side locks correctly but the other doesn t and this is out of the box imagine what folding will be like after you tried to drive this ultralight stroller over a bit of non airport training with those four and a half inch front wheels and jostle up the connection points a bit okay then it s time for the fun part drum roll please let s talk about fake suitcase mode I keep calling a fake suitcase mode because I want to be very clear that that is what it is despite whatever cool fantasies might be dancing around in your brain the book of boo aunt is not a stroller that transforms into a suitcase it s a stroller that transforms into a fake suitcase you can t put anything in the main compartment it s already all filled with stroller boo boo boo calls a trolley motive presumably because of the rear pocket where you can fit a stack of magazines a water bottle and maybe your sunglasses case so what though it looks cool must be useful right when seriously I mean it I love the way it looks too but I ve been racking my brain for weeks and I can t come up with any time fixed suitcase mode is actually really useful or at least useful enough to justify being obviously the main feature of the strollers design let s break it down the ant is clearly meant for airports right travel at least and presumably a fake suitcase mode is meant to make that travel experience more convenient so you re traveling and you have your stroller your kid your luggage and maybe you have your partner as well of course oh and a couple more things firstly you need to know that while the ant is designed to be wheeled while folded down it is not designed with carrying in mind the handle does not lock in the lowest position there is no strap and there s no other obvious handle secondly you ve got only two hands please remember that fact for the following hypothetical scenarios your luggage carries your stuff it can take several forms it can be a backpack it can be a duffel bag or it can itself be a suitcase with the handle and wheels your stroller carries your kit any idea where I m going with this yet no okay let s break down your airport journey into three parts arrival at the airport until you check your luggage and go through security from luggage checking to the gate where you sip lattes and shop your duty-free and from the gate to your seat on the plane where you finally receive the purchase satisfaction of packing your aunt away in the overhead compartment like one of your trip if you have a suitcase on the wheels fake suitcase mode is out because you re not going to pull two suitcases let alone wherever you ve magically spirited your child away too you can however pull a suitcase and push a stroller of course and this deals with where your kid was right but maybe you re more of a duffel bag person that s the setup Bugaboo advertises for the aunt and the photo on their website now you can carry your duffel bag and either push your stroller or pull your fake suitcase of course again with this ladder scenario your kid is still disappeared because there are no hands left for holding him third option a backpack congratulations you now finally have enough hands to look cool with your fake suitcase while carrying your kid okay like two of your journey you ve checked your luggage and you re strolling around the airport or argue would you rather pull your fake suitcase and carry your child where you gonna put that lot a leg three you re at the gate and it s finally time to get your money s worth spend a couple minutes fighting through the many steps to fold down your stroller into fake suitcase mode hoist your kid and strut down that long gangway to the airplane this is assuming of course that you re not boarding the plane up those stairs from the runway remember that the comfort of the ant lies and pulling the fake suitcase not carrying it you find your seat but down your kid depress your handle and what s this a Christmas present from Bugaboo there is a handle on the ant not for carrying but made expressly for the final moment when you re lifting it into the overhead compartment you see in my mind and please leave a comment if you think I m wrong the ant is really only designed for that last leg of the journey I m not saying that there aren t other times you can t want to run around or get carried and stuff I recognize that but the ant is already a stroller it s already a wheeled construction with the handle it s already easy to wheel around whether or not your kid is sitting in it you might still be saying so what to all this so what if the big suitcase mode is mostly useless how does this impact the stroller itself when you re using it as a stroller well that s what I m going to explain now because fake suitcase mode has a huge impact on the ants functionality you see it s not about what s there it s about what isn t there there are tight economies of weight and space that go into stroller design especially an ultra compact travel stroller and these economies of weight and space must encompass all the qualities of a stroller its durability its drivability all of its necessary functions we re going to look at the mechanics of the ant now top to bottom but before we get started take one more look at the ant and ask yourself just from looking at it how much of that space and weight economy do you think has been wasted with that mostly useless fake suitcase mode from a durability standpoint I m actually generally impressed with the construction of the an seat at least in comparison with several of the past iterations of the bee which I had assumed it would be more like but while a bee is made up primarily of a series of relatively thin plastic plates stacked atop each other and incorporates long and fragile plastic components for its mechanisms the ant seat frame has a thicker more durable design with more metal and a sturdy fully enclosed positional adjustment system that being said it is both a rather small and a rather complex eat unit these qualities being result of the need to fit the seat within the confines of the suitcase design the ability to extend the seat back would likely have been present anyway but the long multi hinged wings on the sides of the headrest wouldn t have been and without the need to full is so small I ll bet the whole seat would have been a bit larger too especially the canopy in the long run the real problem with all these mechanisms though comes with the actual folding remember that I said the textiles always seem to get in the way when you re folding it down well each time a strap from the harness or a wedge of cloth impedes one of these mechanisms and prevents you from folding down the seat or attaching the seat unit or locking the rear frame against the front frame asymmetrical stress is applied to multiple points across the chasis over time the best case scenario with all these little annoyances is that the chasis just loosens a bit the worst case is that something breaks so does the handle of this stroller seemed unnaturally long to anyone else or is it just me I m 6 foot so I can t say i exactly mind the long handle but to me it does feel a lot more like a luggage handle than a stroller handle as though it s built more with the idea of pulling than pushing as a suitcase handle it seems more or less normal I don t know I don t work with suitcases but as a stroller handle it s scarily tweaking complex in fact from a mechanical point of view the handle seems the most worrisome element of the entire stroller an 84 centimeter long three tiered telescopic handle topped with a folding mechanism that s only one and a half centimeters wide along is thinnest tube the potential problems with this setup over time are massive from the outset you ll likely already notice that all those connection points at each telescopic Junction as well as the uppermost folding mechanism are a little loose and in addition you might very well get hung up here and there in the folding process by asymmetries and the way each arm slides up or down and locks into place but let s think a little further ahead barring accidents and that s one long thin supposed to be symmetrical internally wired system of an accident waiting to happen just the sheer stresses of use have a good chance of eventually making this handle almost unforgivably loose let me just explain it this way the first time you take this stroller off smooth roads you will likely notice that the aunt doesn t feel quite as bumpy as you might have and you might even think that all our warnings about the importance of suspension and larger front wheels are just hogwash and the boo boo engineers have done it after all and magically made an ultra tiny stroller that can conquer cobblestones but if this is the case I would ask you not just to feel the road with your hands but to look down and check how your child is faring over those bumps you see the reason the uneven terrain might not feel that bad in fact has a little to do with wheel suspension and a whole lot to do with all those loose connection points stretching up the handle that shake away the shock of the vibrate vibrations before they reach your hands a loose handle though is not the same as suspension it does nothing for your child and nothing for the stress and wear that the terrain puts on the chasis including in particular particular those ever loosening points on the handle itself that are the final destination for the kinetic energy of each bouncing jolt by central locking mechanism in the case of the aunt I m actually referring only to the mechanism for releasing and locking the position of the rear frame in its orientation with the front frame it s actually a very simple mechanism which is why it s super cool to see it on a boogie blue model I mean okay the B always had a relatively simple fold or at least a spread out fold encompassing moving parts across the whole chasis but every other boat model from Bugaboo has involved the complex circular clockwork type design in order to allow shifts and orientation between the handle rear and front frames while some of the Davout designs of this sort have functioned decently the boo-boo-boo runner the buffalo and the donkey the rest can generally be seen as the weakest point of their respective models the aunt by contrast in using the combination of telescopic handle with a simple mechanism for unlocking the rear frame in order to fold down falls right in line with a wider trend across the larger stroller market favoring the setup my guess is that Stoica did at first with the exploring but I might be mistaken quit II used to have a model sort of like this as well at milonga xaniix t-series abandoned their age-old crosshatch setup for this system and the Cybex priam essentially uses it to in its own eccentric way so kudos to you Bugaboo Steve you don t actually have to fully reinvent the wheel every time you design a stroller okay the rear frame mechanically there s not much to say about the rear frame the brake the system is thankfully simple again to the madness of the fox it can stick of it sometimes but this is a common annoyance when you re dealing with a pin system where the pin is meant to lock between teeth on the inside facing of the rear wheels usually this happens as a result of excess weight which slightly misaligns the pin necessitating a bit of rocking to snap it back in line when releasing the brakes a little lubrication will go a long way if you re having this problem there s no real suspension on the rear frame but there usually isn t on travel strollers of this size nor are there really any other important mechanisms other than the rear wheels which are just fine and form and functionality there are attachment points for the wheel board though because everybody wants to sell you a wheel board these days with many many years experience I can tell you with certainty that other than hanging heavy bags from your handle wheel boards are the easiest way to thoroughly destroy your stroller in my opinion there are bad ID on all strollers but on a stroller is small and light is the ant they are apocalyptically catastrophic ok the front frame we finally reached the last main mechanical problem with the Bugaboo and I ll give the good before the bad inbuilt wobble protection bukuvu has always been great with this you see a lot of 4-wheel swivel wheel strollers eventually come to stuff from a problem whereby the axle of the front wheels eventually wears down the inside of the front wheel housing causing the front wheels to wobble erratically at speed over the years but google has employed a range of methods for protecting their strollers against this problem and with one exception the first couple of be models for which they eventually issued weight washers they have brilliantly managed to evade it with the and they ve done it again by equipping the front wheels the long axle yet locking the wheels in place beneath a plastic lip at the very bottom of that axle thus shortening the amount of force with which the forks can erode the inside of the wheel housing so that s the good and in my mind there s certainty with this design is the reason they didn t even bother to add swivel wheels to the model here s the bad no not just the bad the horrible awful unforgivable bad of the front end it has four and a half inch front wheels I don t care if the four seven bill suspension I don t care if they kept that awesome Ridge the best of boo-boo-boo models always have their four and a half inches that s as small as the GB pocket why don t you realize how destructive that is to the range of usability for a stroller I thought they got it when they made the fox s front wheels eight and a half inches ensuring the best drivability on the mid-size market but no provided you ve insured against wobbly problems the size of the strollers front wheels are the single greatest factor in where you can use the stroller suspension is important too of course but front wheel size is more important without decent size front wheels you ll bog down and rough terrain before the terrains and evenness becomes an issue to be solved with suspension at four and a half inches boo boo boo has sadly doomed the ant to be that stroller but you can fly to Spain with but not take to the beach that you can walk down the sidewalk with but must stop when it s time across the cobblestones an inch or two it seems so little and yet it mean so much so what are our first impressions of the Bugaboo ant not particularly great as you ve probably gathered at this point I promise you that wasn t our intention before we got a hold of it we don t sell strollers and with us are naturally not the sort of channel that will tell you to buy something even though it s horrible but we also don t want to be the sort of channel that intentionally puts down other people s creations we love Bugaboo despite our criticisms over the micro complexity of the fox s internal mechanisms it s still the best midsize stroller out there but the ant has a number of bonafide design flaws some of which in my mind are pretty serious and people should know about them if for no other reason that you can buy a babies and yoyo way cheaper that a significantly sturdier lighter has a larger seat on larger wheels is easier to fold and has a shoulder strap which is weight handier than the aunts fake suitcase mode and that s just my first choice mechanically I d also rather have a baby jogger city tour or even maybe a Cybex ezs I think that really the amp probably went wrong way back in the early stages of its conception as consumers and Mugu fans we all want to give them the benefit of the doubt and look at the ant as a stroller that has the benefit of transforming into a suitcase but after having a good look at the mechanisms I think there s a good chance that the ant might have been initially conceived in the opposite direction as a suitcase that can coincidentally be transformed into a stroller the emphasis on the handle the rear frame hardshell suitcase aesthetic and that cherry on the cake the front frame handle for lifting but not carrying would all suggest this these elements are nice don t get me wrong but I would trade them all for bigger front wheels and your seat mechanically with better coverage or even a strap or a handle for carrying the thing when it s folded while I pull my actual suitcase you know the one I can fit my stuff into but could we launched an expensive luxury luggage system in 2016 called the Bugaboo boxer and though I have no way of confirming it I sort of suspect that many of the mechanisms on the aunt might be reworks of either mechanisms accepted onto the boxer or rejects that they may have put a lot of work into and wanted to use in one form or another again I can t confirm this but the ironic thing if this hunch is true is that the key innovation of the boxer luggage system was the ability to adjust the chasis holding your suitcases for pushing rather than pulling well with the aunt they re doing the exact opposite in any case we hope this video has been interesting to you and if it has been we asked you subscribe does it help us to continue making videos in the future thank you you

UPPAbaby Vista V2 Stroller,UPPAbaby VISTA V2 Stroller Review - Babylist,"Heads up, there s now a NEW version of UPPAbaby Vista V3! Check it out here ...",44kJzAjeIaQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44kJzAjeIaQ,110696,95,2022-03-15T23:00:22Z,Music this is the upper baby vista v2 a full-size convertible stroller that can support up to three kiddos with a smooth ride and a slew of high-end details and accessories for around a thousand bucks you get all of this the stroller frame and wheels bassinet attachment bug shield bassinet storage bag the toddler seat attachment another bug shield and a rain shield too for reference that is a lot of included accessories so let s get into the stroller options you can stroll with one two or three babies of various ages and stages as a single you can start strolling from birth with the included bassinet or attach your own infant car seat with a separate car seat adapter unless you go with the uppababy mesa that connects without one then once baby can sit up on their own they can enjoy the toddler seat until they reach 50 pounds let s say you have two babies like twins congratulations by the way then you re in luck unlike other doubles say the mockingbird stroller the vista v2 can support two bassinets or two infant car seats at the same time you ll just need to purchase the extra bassinet now if you have two babies of different ages like i did you may be able to carry them both at once with what s right in the box at first but you ll likely end up buying a second seat or a rumble ride along with a set of adapters for when you have two toddlers and if you add a third to the bunch also like i did that s where the piggyback stroller board comes in having so many options can be cool but also a little confusing like you may not realize right away that there are different adapters for the upper and lower levels or that the second seat actually has a lower weight limit than the included toddler seat that being said uppa has an expansion tool on their website to help you visualize it all better while planning and once you ve found the configuration and accessories you like it s easy to get into the groove from day to day as for the stroller adjustments the toddler seat is modular so you can flip it forward or rear-facing and then you can recline it to whichever angle is most comfy for your little one just keep in mind that depending on how you line up the seats you may not be able to fully recline one of the seat as much as the other the ventilated and expandable canopies on both the bassinet and toddler seat have great visibility and airflow and on the toddler seat the canopy is height adjustable which is really helpful for taller kiddos like my lennox the storage basket is impressively large as in it can hold 20 more pounds of stuff than other comparable double strollers like the nuna demigrow and it s pretty easy to access despite the big bar going across the opening there s also a telescoping handlebar which is great for caretakers of varying heights and the stroll is really smooth and durable you can feel the premiumness here the shock shock-absorbing all-wheel suspension glides and turns with ease even as you add more kids and accessories pro tip for you parents with multiples put your heavier kiddo in the back seat parents have said it s really hard to steer with the weight mostly up front now having said that you do have the option to lock the front wheels for a little extra oomph as you manage the added weight or if you re riding on a rougher terrain speaking of weight like most double strollers the v2 is on the heavier side but you ll only need to worry about that for the few seconds that you re folding it down and loading it into the trunk otherwise you can just let it stand up on its own and once it s folded down with the toddler seat attached it s still relatively compact i ll wrap things up by saying the obvious this is a good looking stroller the real leather accents the great variety of color options it s almost hard to choose but what s cool is up a baby will send you four swatches of fabric for free to see which one you like the best before you buy they also offer a three year warranty and a travel safe program that covers damages if you register and gate check your stroller inside of the travel bag the looks are also functional the toddler seat has easy to adjust no re-thread harness straps and the bassinet has water-repellent aerated mattress that s so comfy you could even buy a separate stand and use it as a full-time newborn sleep space overall the uppababy vista v2 is a versatile beautiful workhorse an investment yeah worth it that s up to you i hope this helps Music you
UPPAbaby Vista V2 Stroller,UPPAbaby VISTA V2 Review Best Stroller Travel System,This is a review of the UPPAbaby VISTA V2 and it is arguably the best stroller and travel system for your baby or toddler s . In this ...,euyHcgiY2eU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euyHcgiY2eU,354632,4223,2020-08-06T17:15:01Z,the upper baby vista is one of the most popular and highly rated strollers you ll find and new for 2020 is the vista v2 so let s go look at the stroller find out how it compares to older versions and i ll answer that question is it worth that 1000 price tag Music hey guys andrew here with dad virb and this video is brought to you by pish posh baby pish posh is your source for finding baby gear from brands including nuna bugaboo and more today we re diving into the uppababy vista v2 which you can find linked below let s start with the basic functions and then i ll get into my thoughts on this one main reason the vista attracts so many parents is its build quality and overall longevity this is a stroller meant to last you through multiple kids over the course of several years in fact before reviewing baby gear on this channel this was our very first stroller back in 2017 and we re still using it to this day it can expand to a double and accommodate two kids and with the addition of the piggyback accessory you can actually haul up to three kids which makes this extremely versatile now that note some of the biggest updates made for the v2 were largely centered around the seats the main toddler seat on the v2 is slightly larger with a higher 20 inch seat compared to the 19 incher from previous versions and it also has a deeper two and a half inch foot rest versus the two inches from the older gen they also introduced a non-rethread harness complete with straps that adjust a bit easier than before now one of the most notable changes has been the redesigned canopy and it is near perfect with older models the extended sunshade was tucked into the canopy which was convenient but it was also flimsy and it didn t offer that much more coverage with the v2 the canopy is made up of three panels most of the time the canopy will be extended to its standard two panel form but you can now unzip and expand that third panel and get that full coverage along with some extra airflow through a mesh window to expand the vista to a double you ll need to pick up the rumble c and adapters now what you re not seeing in this footage are the upper adapters which is just another thing to buy we didn t get that they do help with more legroom for the toddler seat but you can get away without it i will say you do need them if you are putting on the infant car seat though now that said it is important to note the differences between the toddler seat and the rumble seat which is smaller the toddler seat can accommodate kids up to 50 pounds whereas the rumble seat maxes out at only 35 pounds so if you have twins at some point when they get older one will sit a little bit more comfortably than the other now if you re not having twins this is ideal for two kids also i mentioned it before but the piggyback is a huge favorite of ours for us we most often go with the toddler seat and piggyback for our oldest as opposed to going with the double seats obviously the rumble seat and piggyback are extra accessories they don t come with the stroller but what does come included is the bassinet it s suitable for infants up to 20 pounds and it is rated sleep safe when used with their bassinet stand now from what i ve seen parents are split on whether or not they want to use the bassinet or just stick with the infant car seat the bassinet is great for maintaining that flat back positioning for spinal development and open airways while the infancy is super convenient with regards to moving the baby from the car to your stroller regardless of your preference it is nice that the bassinet is included though some may just set it aside unused on that note let s chat about car seats without the adapter the vista can take the uppababy mesa car seat which is what we mostly used for our first two kids it s great unless bundled it does come separate and it ll run you about 300 bucks now most parents i see will go in that direction for the mesa but if you re eyeing other options you can pick up their adapter which can accommodate the following infant car seats my favorite on this list being the nuna pipa lite lx that said i am partial to sticking with products under the same brand umbrella so i just recommend getting the mesa as it is the native option i want to note that i ve talked a bit about accessories adapters and whatnot it s annoying that these things cost so much extra but it is nice to know that upper baby has a large range of extras that you can pick up on their site also whatever works for the v2 will also work for the vista models from 2015 and up and as a quick plug buying the vista or any of its accessories through the link below helps support this channel and it s at no additional cost to you guys so if you do end up going with the vista please consider buying through there it is how i stay afloat and it s what keeps my camera rolling for you guys moving on let me briefly hit on the fold on either side of the frame are triggers which you ll need to pull to initiate the fold it is an easy motion and after having tested a bunch of strollers i have a big appreciation for how slim the fold actually is i love the footprint especially when comparing it to the mockingbird or the glue go complete it can fold with both seats on there but sometimes the open can stick a bit personally i just take the second seat off when getting it into the trunk also it can get pretty heavy if you don t the stroller and seat weighs roughly 27 pounds so it is on par with other full sizes in the category the frame itself is made of aluminum and magnesium having flown with the vista multiple times across the us i can attest that it can take hits and it can stand up to those ever so gentle airport baggage handlers but bonus tip if you use uppababy s travel bags for the mesa cruise or vista and register it on their site any damage will be fully covered under their travel safe program so it s a very cool thing that not too many people are talking about at the very top of the frame you ve got a nice leather covered telescoping handlebar which is great for parents of differing heights and moving all the way down the basket got a sleek remodel for the v2 it does remain large and can carry up to 30 pounds of cargo and it includes a storage pocket for smaller carry-along items like your phone and wallet it can be accessed from both the front and rear but one thing i do have to comment on is i ve never been a fan of that crossbar cutting the basket in half it creates an inconvenient divide which has always been an annoyance for larger bags and items now it s not actually an issue i m just annoying and i wish it was a little bit more open like mockingbirds or the nuno demi grows rounding it out let s take a look at the polyurethane wheels it s measuring at eleven and a half inches for the rear and eight inches at the front so same as last year but new for the v2 the tires are softer and the new spring action all-wheel suspension system has been redesigned for a smoother ride on all types of terrain i ll circle back to the feel of the stroller in a moment but just know that this thing glides also new for 2020 is a wheel lock indicator for the front wheels and to cap everything off or the brakes which haven t really changed from older generations it hasn t needed to it s great as is it s a single pedal break with a color indicator to tell you if the break is active so those are all the basic functions color wise you ve been looking at the emmett color style upper babies rolled out a bunch of new colors for 2020 they always seem to be rotating those they ve got great neutrals have a look you ll you ll definitely find something for you now the important part beyond the functions let s get into the buying decision if budget is of no concern i would honestly say get the vista for me it s easily one of the best overall daily drivers that you ll find and it is as close to a perfect stroller as you can get now for those on the fence should i get it should i not this part is for you if you re wondering if the added cost is worth it it is subjective but i would say yes now if you re really trying to stretch that budget and you know that spending over a thousand dollars for the vista and mesa that that s gonna hurt then stop watching don t worry about it google the even flow pivot expand or the mockingbird stroller and then just run with those you ll probably get more value out of the evenflo expand because it does come with that safe max infant car seat either way you re going to be happy with one of those they are a wonderful budget friendly options and you should not feel bad about missing out on something like the vista it s a sentiment that i hear often please don t feel that it s a stroller the other options that i mentioned are great that said the question i often get is why would i spend over a grand when i can just go with the even flow or mockingbird for half the price and be happy and i could point to a couple things to answer that but the main thing is it s all in the details that make the vista a technically more sound and just better option the push is like no other it s the smoothest stroller i ve pushed and it s simply better with terrain versatility suspension turns in single-handed operation the fold is slimmer and somehow has less bulk than the mockingbird despite having the same size the form factor is just more buttoned up here it s easier to get in and out of the back of your car and for whatever reason i pinch my fingers less the customer support warranty and travel safe program all ensure an already remarkably strong stroller and to dovetail that last note the thing that i see most often is that there are times when people have gone with the graco kiko or evenflo option and have come away unhappy for one reason or another they always say they ended up splurging for the vista and never looked back no pain of having to get something fixed or unhappy with the quality they wish they would have just gone with the vista in the first place and called it a day so you are guaranteed a quality starter the way that the pelicans saw zion in the draft i have to end on the basketball reference guys lebron jordan the

Stokke Xplory X Stroller,Stokke Xplory X Stroller Review - Babylist,This modern luxurious stroller with much more than just good looks! Check out the Stokke Xplory X Stroller ...,bC1DxqH99t8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC1DxqH99t8,10459,51,2021-07-06T16:14:44Z,Music this is the stoka explore ex stroller a sleek and sturdy spaceship or at least that s what one of my neighbors called it so here s what s up with the unique design stoka was the first to introduce the idea of bringing baby closer to you while strolling the whole seat itself slides up to help with bonding and help your back with less bending for reference here s another full size single stroller so you could see the seat height difference the other big design difference is the storage basket situation it s perched right up front rather than accessible from the back as you might be used to the cool thing though is that it completely closes to keep all the stuff you re carrying secure and it easily detaches it s about as big as my diaper bag the explorer can support your babe up to 48.5 pounds and be used from birth with an infant insert that s included please note this is the most cushiony and soft insert i ve ever felt i want it in adult form for myself there s also an explore a carrycot or infant car seat and adapters you can purchase separately to stroll with a newborn if you prefer the hard shell seat is modular meaning you can let baby face you or the world and there are a few recline and leg rest positions to try sleep rest and active living up to the exploring name the active position is completely upright and my son jet has definitely been doing a lot more exploring when seated like this it gives him such good visibility on everything around us he s probably also in a great mood though because he knows he looks good and those premium and eco-friendly fabrics this canopy is large quiet and extends for extra ventilation and the seat rail slides out of the way nice and easy too the premium details don t stop a baby though for parents there s a leatherette handlebar that is both height and angle adjustable so both my husband at 5 8 and myself at 5 6 can easily find a good spot and we won t bump our shins on the stroller bars because smart baby spaceship design something we can all enjoy is the smooth ride on puncture free tires that swivel 360 degrees you can lock them in the front if you like and fun fact they remove for easy cleaning too the slim design of the stroller body also makes navigating tight turns pretty seamless even with one hand by this point i feel you wondering what s the catch for me it was the fold to be fair i love a good one-handed self-standing stroller fold the explorer takes a different approach though you remove the seat then close the body and stack the pieces the idea was to make it easier to carry the stroller in two parts but it makes it a little clunkier to store in my trunk or whole closet i ve ended up parking it in the corner because it really is just cool to look at the only other thing is that adjusting the height of the harness straps require quite a few steps you have to use a key and a screwdriver to navigate the sturdy seat shell when you like to move the straps from one height to the next i d say to try to time the adjustment to when you need to remove and clean the seat fabrics because it s a lot of the same steps overall the stock explorer x is a modern and luxurious stroller with much more than just good looks at around 999 dollars it could be the only one your family needs from birth and beyond there are a lot of cool accessories you could try like the stroller boards and snack trays too hope this helps happy exploring Music you

new and it s updated and i m excited about showing you a full review in this video we re going to talk about the stoka pippa car seat that makes it work it works seamlessly as a travel system i ve used the original explorer with my third child so this is a stroll that i actually used and it s really cool to see the the evolution of the stroller in fact i m going to show you break it down for you it s a very unique design the explorer is available to buy from us from magic beans with free shipping so if you re looking for a full list of the best rules to look at for 2021 go over to mbeans.com right now and download the stroller buying guide and without further ado here is the stoka explore ex for 2021. all right guys we have the stoka explorer x the latest generation of stoke explorer now if you ve been watching for a while you know that this is unique because i actually is the last stroller i used for my third child and i m excited about telling you why i love it it s pretty awesome it s definitely unique and so you may may or may not like the look of the stroller i happen to love it it is all about family bonding because as you can see this even with the seat facing out the seat is extremely high this is one of the highest seats of any stroller that is out there you can get up a baby vista with the upper adapters and sort of like make that happen but out of the box this is going to be the highest seat and that s something that parents really rarely think about let me show you how to turn the seat around um there is this very generous foot rest which i m talking what i m talking about in a second you pick up the seat and then you just like loop it through the handlebar and you click it on don t wear the looping it is super super easy but now the baby is so close to you so when you re walking around in your neighborhood through the shopping mall if we go back to malls and you will be able to bond with your baby talk to the baby if you are familiar with the stoka trip trap high chair which is like their iconic like original product it s about family bonding bring the child to the table talk to the child interact with the child same thing goes with the stroller the explorax you re going to walk around the neighborhood and be close to the baby so when you re shopping for strollers take a look how far away is the baby from you when you re trying it out it s that s not something that everyone thinks about they think about like other factors about the weight and other functionalities of the stroller but for this stroller if you want a stroller where you can like really bond with a baby this is the one to get um if you look at the last generation exploring they had a different foot rest but they went back to the original styling of footrest but it s optimized to be larger more generous again back to that stoka of foot rests and when you re stopping for strollers think about where are your child s feet going to rest right you re going to be walking around all day if their feet are dangling they re not going to be so comfortable as they get bigger are they going to be comfortable so with this you can simply by just squeezing a little button below the footrest you can move it up and down as your child gets bigger and you can have your child comfortably lean their feet on the footrest very easy to maneuver very comfortable for the child they ll complain less when they re in the stroller that s a great thing talking about as your child gets older there s a 48 pound weight limit on this thing 48 pounds that s like a four-year-old a five-year-old they are going to be out of the stroller by then so you don t have to worry about like maxing out this thing and you can add a sort of a ride on board with it which i can show you a little bit later in the video stay tuned now they in terms of the seed materials and the textiles it s all made from 100 recyclable material so vehicle friendliness is this sounds overly salesy today i i don t know why i m sorry this is not my intention but i m just like i know i just went into sales mode sorry about that but let s let s just keep trying to do this in a way that s just i just want to tell you about everything i just want you to know want you to love it like i love it that s what s going on here i apologize in advance so new insert new insert super plush and cushy so what you can do is you adjust the stroller then you put your thumb on a thumb thing and you push it in and you can move it all the way back and now i have your baby as a newborn right here in the actual seat you can also get a bassinet for this and click it in as a bassinet if you want to hold bass in that situation it s really really lovely um but if you wanted to get just a normal stroller out of the box under a thousand dollars this time by the way you can well just about a thousand dollars you can put the baby right in the super super soft and plush infant insert which is like easily removable again for that 48 pound big child so like again grows with a child and all of that stuff so nice eco-friendly story with the recyclable material and actually it s super soft it s very silky i really like i love it and it is um um upf 50 so it s sun um sun protecting and it is rain repellent so that s what this canopy could do as well keep talking about the canopy there is a reflector a light reflector here so it s safer to walk around at night and you can unzip it i think this is actually pretty cool and total awesome air ventilation total awesome air ventilation and a giant window to watch your baby as you re walking around with a baby so that is a very cool thing look how breezy if you live in a hot climate and you re worried about the baby getting hot very very cool we will zip this back up nice changing bag on the bottom or like instead of a basket they have this bag which is very cool and again really high um but also you can make it low this is another thing you could bring this to and i um i used to do this when i had the stroller you could bring it to the restaurant with you when we go back to restaurants and you can take if you re watching this i m doing this at the towards the middle to end of the pandemic that s why i keep saying if you go to restaurants you may be watching this a couple years from now there was a pandemic of 2020 2021 if you didn t know that okay click it back in and then you can adjust it to be lower so you just pull out this adjuster on the bottom here and you can adjust the seat lower so now you re in the lower position so if you went to a restaurant like i was saying you can sit the seat the chair up lower the handlebar down and push the seat to the table and you don t have to get some sort of dingy high chair from the restaurant you can literally push your baby straight up or if the baby s sleeping when you walk into the restaurant and then they wake up all you have to do is choose just the adjust the stroller and it actually can like double as a high chair in a restaurant don t have to like put it someplace and that s i think a pretty cool convenient and unique thing about this stroller um in terms of the handlebar since i m touching the handlebar it is easy access one of those easy access handlebars which is really great and there s a leather red handle belly bar and handlebar for the parent or the caregiver let s talk about the the ergonomics of this thing so this is very very height adjustable i m five foot eleven this is very high if you re a tall human being um like the norwegian like this is a norwegian based um brand this can go to at least six feet but if you re very petite person you can lower this um very low in fact i remember my kids are i like two older-ish kids it was like i had a six or four-year-old and a newborn that was like the spacing of my children and i remember when i had my son who was my little one we used to have the kids push the stroller pro tip from a parent have the kids push the stroller so you can like lower this down and literally have is that safe it seems safe to me i can make my own decision so we have the kids push it around and if you re sort of a pt person you can just lower this handlebar to really any position you want so it s neat because you can adjust the seat you can adjust the handlebar and have all these different options for your child let s talk about folding the thing so there s a little loop right here and a little butt a little pull that you pull so you pull it down pull the loop and then you put your foot on the explorer logo on the stoka logo and you push that forward so that is going to enable you to actually put this in an escalator mode or a stair mode so when it s in this two wheel position you can like go up and down stairs or up and down escalators which i think is really neat i would highly recommend you use an elevator but um you can do this i mean when we go like when we walk around our area in brookline there are a bunch of like just like three stairs or four steps that you have to go up and down or even just curves it s just so easy to move the explorer into steer mode and just pop up and down super super easy and then what you can do is you can just lower the handlebar and just put it down on the ground and when you put it into the car you may want to remove the seat you don t have to remove the seat and put it in this position for a more compact situation but um this is big let me i m just watching the end i have a pro tip that i want to share with you but um let s talk about this in travel system mode so you remove the seat and now you just have the actual frame so when your baby s first born maybe you just take your explore frame and bop it into the car you just pull the loop and you pop the wheels out okay i have here a stoka nuna pipa so this is a nuna pipa but it is made for stoka specifically for the explorer and so it has many of the same features of a nuna pipa um after this i ll put a link to below to a other review of a nuna pipa so you can see a full review of the nuna pipa um but it is just like a nuna pipa but let me show you how it works on the actual stroller so i m actually gonna raise this back up you can see that adjuster now that the seat is off you remove it from the base there s a little right pull here and you just take this and you can click it right into the stroller so again even as a travel system nice and high you re talking you re interacting with the child about eight pounds no adapter you don t need to have an adapter but if you have a regular pipa or a kleckling or any other maxi cozy type compatible car seat they do make adapters for that as well um so great pipa um the things that s unique about this um the stoka pippa variety of it is um really nice bright white um touch points for things that move which is good to know um there is no dream drape on the stoka pippa so that s something to note but there is a just a very nice sun visor right here which you can pop in and out there is similar to the explorey there is a very lovely um ventilated a ventilated uh canopy to the stroller so uh to the car seat so the air can breeze through again in the summer in warmer climates that is really nice leather red handlebar as well and then you just push these two buttons and you remove it and put it back into the base um very quickly base has a load leg um rigid latch that enables you to easily just click in like if you re installing the the base you just oops you just click it in in two seconds now if you know this in 2020 nuna came out with a relaxed space so the base for the pipa stoka pippa is the original base but i have a relaxed base here and i ll show you that the stoka pippa can work on the relaxed space so again you just pull this right out takes a second here is the relaxed space um it has that very extra adjustable load leg for extra connection point extra safety um it has this anti-rebound plate which is good for anti-rebound but the most sort of important feature or the most notable feature is it has a adjustable base to position your child correctly in the car so to remove the stoka pipa from the explorer you push these two buttons on the side and you click it right into the relaxed space so even though you or might be buying a stoka pippa for your explorery choose without the um to use without the adapter you can buy an additional relax space um for your for a second car or you can replace the original base that comes with the pipa with the relaxed space if you want this is a perfect time for me to um suggest that you talk to one of our amazing consultants at magic beans you can email us at questions.mbs.com or you can book a consultation at mbs.com consultations where we will talk about everything i just said a lot slower or you can just rewind the video and watch that again so relax space regular bass is very confusing i m also going to be doing a full pipa what s the deal with the nuna pipa video um on the channel so subscribe today let s just quickly talk about the um the right on board because it s really neat okay this is called the sibling board for a sibling and what you do is you attach it right here to the back very easy to push around um they make it so that it is sort of tapered in so when you re walking if you have to take a long walk you don t you don t like to walk on the sibling board but the neat thing is about this particular sewing board this is very smart right here on the back where you sort of close the stroller that is a a there s a magnet happening so when the you re not using like let s say you drop the sibling off at preschool or daycare or something like that just pull the thing up and it s magnetized and you don t have to walk around with it or take it off altogether it s a really really elegant way of storing the sibling board which i think is really neat stoka also came out with this great changing bag a diaper bag it has a number of cool features number one you can hang it on the back of the explorer for extra storage you can use it as a backpack you can also use this as an over-the-shoulder bag really nice to um to accompany the explorey but like i said i promised you a pro tip okay here s your pro tip this is not a stoker product this is a baby s end yo-yo you may be watching this video and thinking yourself hey ellie i know you say that this is like very easy to fold but it seems kind of big i don t i have a very small trunk this is like not the stroller for me that may be true for an explorer but it s probably also true for a bugaboo fox or an upper baby visto or a cybex primer or all of these other strollers that you may be looking at in addition um like while you re looking at the explorer as well so what i recommend to you and i recommend to all parents is to get two strollers you get this big stroller for walking around the neighborhood for extra comfort for baby but then in terms of like travel or throwing something easy into the car again whether it s an explorer or a vista you want something just really light and convenient for the car you may not get that from day one but i guarantee you as a parent of three and somebody s helped thousands of parents most people get at least two strollers you get your explorer for the home right with a nice seat in the plush situation and then you get your yoyo for the car and you have your two strollers you have your house stroller and your car stroller if you like this video please give it a like and if you want to see more videos like these please subscribe today and unfortunately this stroller just came out so it isn t in my roundup of my best rollers of 2021 video but that has many many like dozens of strollers and i recommend that you watch that video right after this one and i will see you at the next video thanks for watching
Stokke Xplory X Stroller,Stokke Xplory X Review Best Stroller 2022,In this video I will review the Stokke Xplory X stroller best stroller of 2022. I ve been using this stroller for 5 months on a daily ...,bBOyEbaPiig,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBOyEbaPiig,43290,368,2021-10-06T01:36:03Z,hey everyone welcome to mighty kiddos so today i want to share with you the pros and cons of this stroller stokey explorer x i have been using it for five months and there is although there s a lot of things i like about it there s still a few that i m not too crazy about so if you are interested in shopping around for a stroller and want to hear a real experience of somebody that has been using it for some time stay tuned and join me Music hi everyone welcome to my kiddos so the first thing i want to share with you about the stroller is aesthetically it is a beautiful looking stroller i guarantee you there is no other stroller that looks like this and what also i like about the design is that they took minimalism in mind and they made it functional for everyday parents so another point that i want to make about the style of the stroller and what i really like about it is that they use really good materials for it and the craftsmanship is apparent throughout the whole stroller this material here on the canopy is made with a repellent material that is really good to repel water and other liquids and therefore you don t need to buy a rain shield for your stroller which gets it ready to go once you unbox the stroller also another good thing about this is how they ve taken safety in consideration i really really love the five point harness that this stroller has it s very secure and it s really easy to operate all you do is push up a button you can release everything and you re ready to get your baby in your arms and also this brake system here with the top of your foot it is locked and it is not going anywhere so safety is not only taken into consideration but they ve also made it easy to to apply and another thing that i really like about the stroller it s very versatile in terms of the child is able to sit facing the parent or able to sit facing the world however this brand stokey has taken the stroller to another level which is uncomparable in the sense that the seat also moves up and down to allow more connection more bonding between parent and child you could bring the baby when the baby is an infant you can bring it all the way up also bringing the seat all the way down when the baby is a toddler it allows him to exercise his independence by coming in and out of the stroller as he pleases so another feature that i like about this is the sun shade it really unzips and it comes down really low as you can see here to add and provide an extra protection for my child especially now during copy times i don t like being around crowded places but when we have to be the baby s in the stroller and he s well protected from everybody else s germs and i do like that the there is a reflector back here and this allows for more visibility and protection when you re outside and you re running or walking and you know it s dark and this little zipper here and it allows for ventilation proper airflow when the baby is in the seat so that s really good i do also like that the infant insert you could just take it off and now it becomes a deeper seat for a toddler to to be able to sit in and stroll the other added feature about this stroller is the three angles at which you can position the the seat on you can so this is really versatile and allows like i said in every point of design you can see how they were thinking of connecting making that connection between the child and parent a lot easier so i do like these three positions it does make it easy for for you to connect with your child and for the child to connect with the world around him and the other aspect that i like about this is that you could lock the front wheels with ease and that allows you to just rock the baby back and forth another thing that i like about is the ease of maneuvering this whole stroller all you really need is one hand it is so easy to control you one hand you hold it a handle and it s so easy to handle that my six-year-old helps us with the baby as well i love i love the handle aspect it saves your wrist believe it or not so i really like this is like a little perk that i feel spoiled with when they when you could flip the angle a different way and also the length of the bar could go up or down to accommodate my son for instance and accommodate my husband and me i know i ve talked about all the things that i love about it the thing i don t really like about it is that when putting the stroller in your car basically you need both hands you need to remove the seat that s the first step and then the second step is you have to um put the stroke fold the stroller up and put it in in your car i have an suv and let me tell you it is not easy to carry that thing up there in my stroller it does take a lot more room that i would want and i have to talk about this basket compartment at first i was really not happy about this let me tell you it is enough room for it it is as big as my diaper bag and um a lot fits in there but the like i said they took it to another level by adding the zipper so it gives you that that privacy that you want and it does have these two other hooks up back here where you can t purchase the diaper bag through them and it just locks right in there yeah i ve been using this one for five months and i could not have chosen any other stroller i really love this one it s beautiful it s amazing it works well and it looks amazing i love it so if you like this video don t forget to give it a thumbs up and share with other parents perhaps those that are looking or shopping around for a stroll and let me know what you think in your comments below thank you so much for joining me and i can t wait to see you in our next video take care Music you

Parenthood so today I am here with the Nuna mix next stroller this is nuna s single stroller it is incredible and we absolutely love it for so many reasons so I m going to share all of those features from top to bottom finishing with the folds so let s get right into it foreign now starting from the top you have the telescopic handlebar here there s actually two buttons on the side that you re going to press and then your handlebar will cut will come up and down to your desired height this is also the fashion riveted which is absolutely gorgeous Nuna is known for their fashionable and really really prestigious fashion moments so there is a really nice chocolate leather detailing here black Fabric and then you just have some really nice kind of like brassy gold chocolate leather detailing throughout which is incredible so really really nice handlebar you also have a beautiful canopy this is UPF 50 plus it is also extendable so it has some really really nice extension here it also has a nice magnetic little peekaboo window and some extra ventilation at the top so you have two areas with both ventilation and you can peek on your little one when needed there is also an amazing recline with this seat so you can actually utilize this seat from birth up until 50 pounds so you have a really really nice recline here true flat recline and you can lift up that foot rest to create that newborn bassinet style moment which is absolutely incredible the seat is really really nice on the Nuna again accommodating that little one from birth up until 50 pounds you have a no re-thread harness back here for those quick adjustments as well as a magnetic Buckle so this is something that is new on the Nuna seat which is really really nice it just comes apart and then Clips back in super quickly something else that I absolutely love is the seat so you have this winterized full season bamboo seat and then in the summer when you need that extra ventilation and extra airflow you can actually remove move this bamboo insert and you get a full summer seat here with so much ventilation it truly is incredible especially for those hot moments those humid summer days you have a really nice adjustable calf rest here which is great a really nice leather bumper bar as well and you can also switch this out for a snack tray if you wanted to the seat is also reversible so

flip up divider and a really nice pocket in the basket as well for extra storage you also have a cute little phone pocket back here on the back of the seat if you want to put your phone there which is great um so really nice options for storage you have full wheel suspension which is awesome for any terrain and then one thing that is really really nice about the Nuna mix next is that when you purchase the nunamix next you re going to get your seat you re going to get your stroller frame and you are going to get a ring adapter so the ring adapter is the added accessory that comes with your stroller and this is going to make life so much easier when you purchase a Nuna infant car seat so any of the Pippa series car seats you re just going to take the seat off here add your ring adapter and then with your HIPAA series infant car seat you can just clip it on super easy and you now have your full travel system so you can utilize the seat from birth or you can put your Nuna pipa series car seat on top as well just making a really really nice travel system here so I m gonna take off the seat and the ring adapter put back on our stroller seat because we have entered the fold foreign

Nuna MIXX Stroller,Nuna Mixx Stroller Review - Babylist,The amazing suspension and stylish look make the 2019 Nuna Mixx stroller a parent favorite. Scout Julie details more!,6icB83yTzig,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6icB83yTzig,131277,450,2019-12-13T02:09:45Z,if you re wanting to know the ins and outs of the 2019 nunavik stroller then you re in the right place I ve been using the stroller with my six-month-old and my three-year-old and I am obsessed with how incredibly smooth this stroller is the nuna mix is a full-sized single stroller that has all the amazing qualities you look for in a luxury stroller this version is an upgrade of their 2018 nuna mix2 model and it still has all the details that parents love about the nuna mix but now with some exciting updates the mix cost about 650 and features foam-filled tires and four-wheel suspension which makes it really incredibly smooth over all kinds of terrain and easy to maneuver with one hand with front wheels that lock for those bumpy or rides the stroller itself weighs about 27 pounds so not the lightest and can accommodate a child up to 50 pounds and up to 45 inches a stand out feature is that it s newborn ready it has a five position one-handed recline that has the ability to lay flat for a newborn and when you button up the footrest it creates a bassinet type environment for your little one so there s really no need to buy an additional bassinet for the stroller the insert can be removed to reveal a mesh seat back to keep baby cool in hot weather and the insert itself is made of a moisture wicking bamboo so it s nice and plush and cozy for those colder months the new no rethread harness makes it really easy to adjust as your child grows it has a reversible seat so your child can face you or face out into the world all by simply pressing these side buttons and switching it around not only that but the strollers two-step fold is quick and easy and you can fold it with the seat facing you or facing out the stroller opens pretty quick and effortlessly now let s talk about canopy because that s an area that I think that nuna really shines the mix has an oversized UPF 50 plus extendable canopy with a flip-out shade that can easily tuck back if you don t want to use it and if you unzip the zipper it reveals another panel with mesh sides giving your baby complete coverage for a cool and comfy ride there s also a peekaboo window with magnetic closure so it won t wake your baby if you go to check on them there s even yet another that reveals more mesh lining to allow for more airflow let s just say your baby will not complain about being hot in this Buffy other features include a 5 or three-point harness adjustable leg rest an easy flip-flop break two sided large storage basket that collapses for larger items a zipper area for keys or snacks and a pocket on the back perfect for your phone and an adjustable handlebar it s offered in a few different color options and features a brown leather at handlebar and child s arm bar it also includes a ring infant car seat adapter so you can easily turn this into a travel system using one of the nuna Pippa series of infant car seats additional accessories like a rain cover bassinet cup holder a child s tray travel bag can all be purchased separately all right let s recap what s to love about the 2019 noona mixed roller this is one luxurious ride for you and your baby those high-end details are not to be beat like the brown leather at handlebars the all-weather seat will keep your baby cool and summer with the mesh backing or cozy in the winter with a plush insert the seat can face you or the world and it can fold either way its newborn ready with the flat recline and a bassinet feature the large canopy offers full coverage and features multiple ventilation options a peekaboo window and a flip-out eye shade when folded it can trolley like a suitcase and lastly my six-foot-five husband loves how high the handle bar goes it truly is one of the highest and that s really good for two parents of vast height difference as for things to consider the rain cover is not included and I find that pretty necessary to use with the stroller so you re looking at spending an additional 40 which leads me to it s pricey for a single stroller that doesn t convert into a double and if you are hoping to use this with two children nuna doesn t offer a ride along board there is a company called lascal which makes a buggy board that is compatible with it you just have to check their site for the correct model and fit I m not a huge fan of the five-point harness I find it a little hard to connect especially hard when baby is crying I do wish the seat was a little deeper for my toddler and the stroller can only become a travel system using a nuna Pippa infant car seat no other brands are compatible lastly when it s folded it s not self-standing and it does take up a little bit of real estate overall this stroller is smoother than silk easy to maneuver with one hand and really comfortable for you and your baby hope this is helpful Music

next is a thousand dollars and it s crazy that strollers i m talking about a thousand dollars for a stroller like when did strollers get this expensive but the reality is you get a nice quality stroller that is great for pushing around the neighborhood that s newborn compatible when you get the nunu mix next so a lot of strollers you ll notice with the nix next is that has a full recline for newborn so what i can do is i can just pull this little tab on the back a little silver tab it goes down to the bottom and then the you can put your baby from newborn and in fact what you do is underneath here do these little snaps and you unsnap this and unsnap this and now you can create and you can just snap it in right here and it sort of catches the baby i mean they re not really catching the baby but um it just keeps it safe and you can have your baby here from newborn you can also get a bassinet for the baby following absolutely flat recline also with this there is a nice pad which is soft and cushiony for your baby and there is a summer seat on the back so if you are having your baby in the summer or if you have a toddler in the summer or if you live in a warm climate you can remove this pad and have the air flow through from the back they also have their magnetic technology so you can see it s a magnetic buckle so it s really easy to get the baby um like in and out of the stroller um other strollers like an upper baby vista and upper baby cruise which maybe strolls that you re looking at have more of like a wedge design so you can t put your baby in it um straight away you know so and you know magic beans that s the that s my amazing business called magic beans and uh in that beads.com we this is definitely one of our most popular strollers um the other thing that s people people like about this is that it comes with a car seat adapter included so let me show you that for a second um it s great because like when i had kids you know like many years ago my kids are teenagers or even i actually have a 20 year old already the quality of strollers just really wasn t as great and it s really nice that in you know 2022 you can get a stroller like this that is like super quality super good quality and has like all these great like features in fact the seat goes in both directions so you could just like pull up these little buttons here on the side and again now you can look at your baby but let me get to that car seat adapter so you remove this here is your new ring adapter so they have like the wider side or the longer side and the shorter side put the longer side out so you can put it in like this click it right in and here i have the nuna pipa lite rx so there are um six different types of newness car seats i do a video i ll put a link below um describing the six different types of nuda pipa car seats this only works the nuna pipa but is our most popular car seat it s extremely safe and this is the new pivot light rx which is the top of the line one and you can see boom it clicks right in so now you can walk around with your baby like take them out of the car put them right into the stroller which is cool and then to remove it you just pull this little it s like a little pull like a little enough squeezy thing on the back and you open it up and it goes right out and you can even fold down your stroller with the car seat adapter on so what you do is you just pull this over and this folds right down there s a little latch on the side where you can like unlatch it opens right up and to remove the car seat adapter you just push these two buttons and it removes um nice big basket there is a zipper on the back of the basket so you can put some stuff in there if you wish and you can also like i said in terms of folding it down with the seat attached what you can do is just fold the seat over and then what you do is what i norm what i can do is look here s a little trick put your foot on the back axle squeeze in these two things and then you can just pull this towards you and it like stands up here on its own just like that so you don t have to go down to the ground and then you can like boom lift it back up and and there you go um flip flop friendly break which is really cool so you don t have to like use the bottoms of your foot you just go down and up i forgive my white dirty shoes like i love my white dirty my white shoes and my kids say that i should always clean them and i do but the white shoes get dirty um and then right here the thing that makes the noodle mix next a next thing is that they have improved suspension on like on the back of the of the back towards the back wheels like really good springy suspension so you re the baby is really not going to feel that much movement this can be very comfortable for the baby um also there is an extendable canopy unzip here and you can see unzip the canopy and you have the air that flows through so if you want to have your own consultation learning about car seats you should definitely go to mbeans.com consultation and one of our experts at magic beans will help you figure out exactly um what stroller is right for you and for your family okay one more thing about the nudi mix next is it has a extendable handlebar so you push in these two buttons here and this goes up pretty high i m five foot eleven and you can sew

Bumbleride Indie Stroller,Bumbleride Indie Review All-Terrain Strollers Best Strollers 2022 Magic Beans Reviews,"If your strolling routine features more than flat sidewalks and smooth pavement, you might be looking at all-terrain stroller options.",oDfgwU2_FH4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDfgwU2_FH4,12658,141,2022-05-03T15:19:15Z,can this stroller really handle the snow and the beach you re about to find out Music i m so excited to do a full review of the bumbleride indie i ve never done a indie review didn t realize that i ve done some comparisons but this is a full review so if you re looking at the indie this is the video to watch i m ellie from magic beans videos i review and compare strollers and car seats on youtube if this is your first time meeting me and if you ve seen the channel before welcome back um i own the best baby store in the country it s called magic beans and beans.com we ship all over the country um book a virtual consultation today and shop at mbeans.com with free shipping okay here is the bumbleride indie um one of the things i like about this is that it is an eco-friendly product so the materials are all recycled material yeah ecotec okatex certified so it s um it doesn t have harmful chemicals in it and i we love bumble ride s commitment to the environment now this is an all-terrain stroller it is not a running stroller now you can run with it if you wanted to you could run with any stroller but this is not a running stroller one of the trademark non-running stroller aspects of this but this is an all-terrain stroller is that it has 12-inch wheels on the back it has three 12-inch wheels versus other ultra um all other running strollers that have 16-inch wheels on the back the other thing is that this does have a does have a swiveling front wheel so it s really easy to maneuver but when you lock it it locks in versus locking out so this is really an all-terrain product but an advantage of having it be an all-terrain product is that it s appropriate from newborn so without a car seat adapter or a bassinet this does take a car seat adapter and a bassinet you can out of the box put your baby right into a stroller so if you re looking at this versus um the like an upper baby ridge or a bob flex or thule urban glad to all those things none of those are newborn compatible straightaway you have to use some sort of accessory this is so it s a full recline for newborn and also what you can see is um we recommend that you um let me put this in the newborn position um we recommend that you remove the front bumper bar it s a little button here just remove it and remove this and then what you do is you just lift this up and you ll see that there are buttons and you can button these together and now you create it but on both sides and you can create this little bassinet environment safe the baby doesn t fall out and that is great it also has a very high weight limit so this really lasts a really long time like i said it s a great all-terrain stroll i love all terrain strollers i don t know about you but here in boston the sidewalks are horrible they are cobblestone they are brick they can be eroded because of the snow and we need all-terrain strollers to get through our go through our lives um also like snow in the winter it uh so many months of the year the roads are just not appropriate for those smaller plastic wheels so these great all-terrain wheels are fantastic now these are air filled tires now i believe that airfield tires are the smoothest push so when you re pushing through that snow or if you re going to the beach and you want to get through that get through that sand this is going to do a great job there s a little zipper pocket on the back and also you can unzip here and just create like a more open environment for your baby so you can look at look at them so let s fold down the stroller let s take the belly bar let s lower the lower position and then what we do is right here there are two little pulls on the side and you flip it over and well you can flip it right down like that and then it locks closed there s a little latch on the side here and then you just unlatch it and you can flick it over again um like i said you can add a car seat adapter to this you can add a you can add a bassinet to this so you can use this in all those different types of configurations and it s just going to push really really well this is featured in my best strolls of 2022 which i m going to put in our stroller playlist in the link below if you like this video don t forget to like and subscribe it makes a huge difference for our channel i will see you at the next video Music

Next, swivel the front wheel in front of you and look for the handle levers and squeeze. The stroller will fold down on its own and you ll hear it lock clicking sound of lock engaging thanks to its auto lock. We ve also got a quick-release for a more compact fold. Indie also features a standing stow for your garage or closet. To reopen the stroller, push the auto lock away from the frame and open the stroller in front of you. I d like to show you how to attach a bassinet or car seat adapter to Indie. The first step is to remove the canopy. You can also choose to remove the seat fabric if you d like. I m going to show you how to attach the car seat or Bassinet with the seat fabric on. First, remove your hinge slot covers on each side of the inside of the seat. Next, install the provided hot shoes and hardware with a Philips head screwdriver and repeat on the other side. Now you re ready to recline the backrest, remove the Bumper Bar, by pushing on the buttons on each side of the Bumper Bar, sliding it out. Now, you can attach your Bassinet or car seat adapters. To attach the Bassinet, locate the Hot Shoes and line up the receivers while you push down. To remove, locate the fabric handles and the grey buttons. Push and lift. To attach a car seat, first identify which adapter you need for your car seat. I m going to show you the clek, maxi cosi, Cybex, nuna adapters. Next, locate the right and left indicators when facing the front of the stroller and attach to each respective Hot Shoe. To attach a clek car seat, line up the adapters with the clek receivers and push down audible clicks of latching adapters . To remove, locate the release lever, pull, and lift up. When you re no longer using the car seat and you re ready to fold the stroller, make sure to remove the adapters by pushing on the grey button and lifting up, on each side. If you have the fabric removed, you do not need to remove the adapters, to fold the stroller. If you have any questions or concerns about car seat compatibility please call or email kandi bumbleride.com or 1-800 530 3930"
Bumbleride Indie Stroller,Review Bumbleride Indie Stroller,Buying a stroller is like buying a car. It s a big investment and you want to ...,N9L9M295yC8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9L9M295yC8,80663,154,2011-07-26T15:30:00Z,Music you seen the new denim pull-ups yeah I m totally wearing them right now I got skinny ones they make skinny pull-ups totally wait look at that fresh ride W love the color and those rims what kind of stroller is that this is a bumble ride Indie now Bumble ride is a US company started by husband and wife team that were first frustrated with the strollers on the marketplace so they decided to create their own and I m so glad they did because their strollers really are about high design and great functionality this is actually the natural addition which of course Mama natural had a try and the reason why is because 50 of this external um material is made of recycled Fabric and then the interior seating area is actually made of 50 bamboo which is temperature regulating now the thing that s great about the stroller and really unique is that it s customizable beginning with this h handle bar this actually can go high or can go low depending on how tall the person pushing it is it also has this adjustable back for the seat so it can literally recline laying flat which is great for your baby to take a good snooze while you re giving them a walk and then lastly it s got an adjustable footrest here so it really grows with your baby this is really a one- siiz fits-all from infancy all the way up to a 45 lb child one of the first thing you ll notice about the stroller is this beautiful canopy now this canopy literally will go all the way forward to block those front sunblast that babies hate so much it also has got a really ample cargo space below in fact Mike and I can fit two bags of groceries in this thing which is awesome then it s got these great 12in air filled wheels these are allterrain wheels that goes over curbs Stones grasses and it rides as smooth as silk now in terms of folding this guy up it s pretty easy you just take these two trigger points push your stroller forward and then lift up like that so it s not so bad now the one thing I would say in terms of improving this stroller is that it doesn t give you it just kind of lays down like this so it takes up a lot of horizontal space um the way Mike and I are kind of fixing this is we re um we installed a bike hook at our back door and so we re actually going to hang it so it takes up less space now in terms of opening it up this guy is a dream it literally is like that you just snap it open awesome so it s really easy even my mom can do it there you have it the Bumble ride Indie Mama natural gives it a big thumbs up really grateful to Bumble ride for letting us try out this stroller and if you re in the market for one be sure to check it out hey Griffin Griffin over here oh my gosh that thing is so hot totally Music
Bumbleride Indie Stroller,Bumbleride Indie 4 Stroller Review by Baby Gizmo,"Hollie Schultz of Baby Gizmo reviews the new, soon-to-be released Bumbleride Indie 4 stroller.",dA8f5HrNVBY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA8f5HrNVBY,48950,97,2014-05-08T03:06:48Z,Music hey everyone it s Holly from baby Gizmo today we re taking a look at the new Bumble ride Indie 4 now I ve brought us outside because Bumble ride designed this stroller to bridge the gap between the urban errands like going to the store and shopping at the mall and the off-road Adventures such as you know Trail walking but what they did is they took jogging out of the equation if you re a jogger then you re going to definitely want to go with traditional Indie but this one you know what it s not for jogging we re not all joggers sometimes we just want to like to walk the trails we like to do everyday errands but you know what we like to go off the beaten path too so this is a four-wheel stroller that still has all-wheel suspension air fill tires and it has all kinds of great features that I know you re going to want to check out plus it comes with a bassinet so this is infant newborn ready so it s going to go all the way from newborn as your child grows to about 3 or 4 years old now before we get into the stroller too much I do want to let you know that I m going to do a side by-side comparison of the indy4 and the regular Indie so that you can see the different features and determine which is the best for you now the nd4 has a 55 lb weight capacity the seat is 13 in wide seat back is 18 in wide and from the back of the seat to the top of the canopy up here it s 25 in there is an adjust able five point harness it s also a breakaway harness which means the two pieces the shoulder piece and the the um the piece that goes around their waist breaks away but what I love is it Clips in place so it s not going to fall apart every time you take your child out of the Buckle there s an adjustable removable baby bumper bar now the only reason you would adjust it is to fold it you would adjust it down there s also an adjustable calf rest here with different positions all the way up to there and then you put it down there the older children are going to set their feet on this easy to clean fabric down here very very easy to wipe clean now the recline in the seat has a very deep recline you could technically I think put a newborn in the seat but it comes with the bassinets you might as well use the bassinet or the included car seat adapter with an infant car seat but let s know that it is a very deep reclined one-handed strap system you pull it back wherever you want to stop you stop pushing the button and that is a deep recline let me just show you how far it goes up as well and that is a pretty upright seat as well so those kids that don t like to be always reclined has an upright seat and a deep recline now this is not a reversible seat Bumble ride just like the Indie it s a forward-facing seat um so just know that not a switchable seat but definitely great with the bassinet and um the car seat adapter now let s talk about storage on the ind4 there s a cup holder on the side it is removable and you can put it on either side of the handlebar there s also a little pocket on the back of the canopy for a cell phone or a set of keys now the basket underneath this is a really good basket CU it has easy access the access is from the back you re going to be able to put a large diaper bag in here with no problem the sides are high so it is a deep basket um but you re not going to be able to get a lot of stuff in from the sides the majority is going to be right here from the back but it is a decent size basket for sure now let s talk about these wheels because these wheels are what make the ind4 there are four of them of course um they re all airfill tires there s no you know hard rubber Wheels here these are these are airfi tires that are going to charge to all kinds of terrain has all-wheel suspension so you can take this on the you know off the the the be off the Beaten Track you can because these wheels are going to just charge through everything grass playground molds gravel everything um definitely um the one thing about it is it doesn t come with a tire pump most strollers these days do not so it s I m not shocked by any means so I just know you might want to have a tire pump on hand just in case you never know front wheels these are 8 and 1 2 in swivel wheels 360 you lock them straight individually that s what you re going to want to do when you go on all terrain that s going to give you better maneuverability so it doesn t get caught up in the bumps if you re shopping around the store on smooth surfaces keep them in the swivel mode now these back here these are 12in airfi tires this is what s on the traditional Indie you would have three of these but they put these in the back and the 8 and 1 2 in smaller wheels in the front it s going to be great for maneuverability around tight corners but also like I said like this like with I got a whole bunch of dirt here and um grass and Hills it s going to be great for that there s a one step break in the back all you got to do is step down that s going to lock it into place and then lightly pull up that is going to let it go free let me just tell you the maneuverability is amazing on this I move it around onehanded like I said no problem on the trails the dirts the hills anything like that now let s talk about this canopy oh actually let s talk about the fabric first it s still the eco-friendly fabric that Bumble ride is known for it s made of 50 pet which are like recycled bottles 14 recycled bottles to be exact and 50 bamboo charcoal fiber so eco-friendly Fabrics comes in all the great colors that bomb Bread s known for absolutely love it now let s talk about this canopy it s a big canopy right it s traditional Bumble ride full coverage canopy two huge panels there is a peekaboo window and did you hear that there is no Velcro on the peek-aboo window it s the little things that get me excited people I m telling you it s a mesh window that allows air to circulate through which is great but I love there s no velcro to wake up a baby now there s a little storage pocket back here on the back of the canopy and it s small enough for a cell phone set of keys very small um but definitely a really good full coverage canopy I could pop it in front of the child down to the baby bumper bar if the seats up right just for even more coverage now let s talk about this handle this handle is for taller and shorter parents alike it goes all the way down to 26 in from ground to handle to 43 in and that is up up like this so it s going to be kind of taller so if you re really really tall this isn t going to telescope out though so this is the best position for really tall parent so it is an adjustable handle I love that fact um again there s the cup holder on the side it also has a runaway strap so if you are on the trails and things get crazy I don t know this would keep the stroller attached to you like that and it just loops on The Handlebar there now let me show you how you re going to fold the ind4 you re going to make sure your canopies back put down that baby bumper bar very easy like that there are two levers on either side you re going to want to pull those up flap the handle bar forward grab this strap push it in like that now here s the thing guys it has two automatic locks on the side but what I found is that you are going to have to get those wheels in the right position for them to engage so they re kind of like automatic locks I don t know they re not they don t automatically lock for me I m just saying I m because you got to make sure that your cup holder not in the way and stuff like that but if you have your handle bar in the perfect place you get it all locked and you re on a stable surface which I m not it does have a standing fold it is 22 lb Del little bit heavier than the original Indie and that s because it has those that extra Tire pretty much so it has four tires instead of three I do like the fact that it has the standing fold I like the fact that it has two locks on either side but just know they don t engage automatically um because those front wheels kind of get caught up undo them open it up like this until you get that front wheels to Flap out until it locks into place put your bumper bar back up adjust your handlebar it s very easy to open and close I m just saying I just wanted to let you know about those front wheels sometimes they re in the way sometimes you got to move them not that big a deal though now with the included Basset you have turned your ind4 into a pram there is also an included Universal car seat adapter this works with a variety of different infant car seats you want to check Bon blue ride s website to see which ones are compatible but I love the fact that you can also turn it into a travel system um really really great option I know that they were on the fence about whether to include the bassinet or not ultimately they decided that you are getting the Basset with it and that s great because you know what I love bassinets with strollers especially when you re using it with a newborn and when you decide that when the baby s old enough you remove the canopy take off uh the bassinet off the frame and then it goes back into the taller seat so definitely a really versatile stroller I first of all I love the the maneuverability it s very very easy to push and that s because it s all wheel suspension and the air filled tires the seat is roomy accommodates up to 50 5 lb so you got all kinds of you know great options on this and it s again for those people that don t necessarily jog they don t um cuz it s not a jogger definitely not for the joggers it s just for those people that you know they just want to get off the beaten path with their babies sometimes so there you go that s just kind of my look at the new Bumble ride Indie 4 um again comes in all kinds of different colors check the website you ll see them all there um but that s it um give me a com leave me a comment let me know do you like the new Bumble ride four the Indie 4 did you like the Indie better um just tell me what s your favorite feature about it and that s it don t forget to like us on Facebook please subscribe to our YouTube channel and I will talk to you next time I m Holly Schultz from baby Gizmo bye why is it every time I

Joolz Day Stroller,Joolz Day Folding Guide,"In order to keep our recommendations up to date, we maintain a Buyer s Guide with a wide spectrum of models, and a lot of ...",vXLTN-WZqFg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXLTN-WZqFg,29351,79,2020-09-12T20:40:41Z,this is a jewels day plus and today we re going to show you how to fold this model down with the bassinet as well as with the seat and also how to make it as small as possible if you are looking to conserve space for a trip or something like that so we re going to start off with the bassinet and it s quite important with this model that you actually apply the brakes and in particular lock the front wheels when you re folding this model that s because it doesn t have a lock when it s in the folded down position unless you re in australia then it has like a strap lock but for the rest of the world it doesn t actually have any function for locking it down and so if those front wheels are not locked in place they re going to get in the way and stuff as you re trying to fold it down so when you have the bassinet attached you re actually going to have to remove the bassinet and then fold down the chasses there s a two piece fold in order to remove the bassinet you re going to press in on these two buttons on the side here and then you can lift the entire thing off and then we can proceed to fold down the chassis itself so here at the top you have this metal lever and this is for the handle extension so press in on both of those levers and you can slide in that handle and then under here there s a trigger with a little white safety button so you re going to press in on that white safety button pull up the trigger and then the handle will just fold down and you can pull up the stroller and just set it down and it will stand up okay in the interest of making this bassinet then as small as possible in case you want to conserve space and fold down our canopy and actually put in our sunflower first remove the bumper bar slash handle and then on the inside here are a pair of struts that you can change the orientation of in order to fold the carrycot down flat so if you remove your mattress you ll see that they re right here in the front and in the back and there is a velcro strap first that goes to the side of the bag here here and then once you attach that you can just pull these struts towards each other or towards the center and that allows the bag to now be soft like this the last thing you need to do is if you pull in on the handle adjustment trigger this allows you then to fold up the connection struts a little bit to give you a little added space and that s as flat as it gets all right we re going to cover the seat then starting with reverse position and in the reverse position you do actually need to remove the seat unit in the same manner that you remove the bassinet so you can push in your foot rest it s this button right on the bottom front of the footrest to adjust the length and then you re just going to depress those two buttons on the sides again to remove the entire seat frame and then you can fold down the chasses in the same manner so sliding in the handle pulling up on those triggers you just lift up you ll get a easy standing fold in the interest of making the chassis as flat as possible as well then for uh trips and stuff you ll want to remove all of the wheels so in order to remove the rear wheels there s this large button in the center i m just going to press in and pull them off and then as far as the front wheels are concerned there s this large white button here you re just going to depress that and it will unlock the front wheels and then we can now fold down the chassis in the same manner there we go a nice compact little unit then we can fold in the sunflap pull down the canopy and then you can of course remove the bumper bar as well all right so then lastly is going to be the fold that you re probably going to use the most which is the one piece fold which is only possible with the seat facing forward so you want to pull back your canopy pull in your foot rest and then adjust your seat to this position at least that position is optimal then you can put down your handle and just fold it down and lift up on that bar and you ll get your standing fold with the seat attached so that s gonna be most useful just for storing the stroller in your hallway or if you re gonna like fold it down and just put it into your car and stuff and then you can of course just lift it up to pull it back into its locked upright position so in any case that was our guide to folding the jules day plus we hope that you found this video useful and if you did we ask you subscribe as it helps us continue making videos in the future thank you

While I love Mockingbird, ...",ko0h9xjx-bI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko0h9xjx-bI,128900,1885,2022-07-01T15:59:31Z,hey guys Andrew here with Dad verb today we re going to be diving into the UPA baby Cruise V2 and discuss whether or not you should buy this or a double like the Vista V2 now before we start please hit that like button down there you guys have been crushing our like goals recently and it really helps other parents find these reviews so the cruise is arguably my favorite stroller I ve ever reviewed and I ve covered a lot on this channel people often ask like you know how does this compare to Silver Cross or Mockingbird or Peg Parago list goes on uh and in most cases I would probably take the cruise over any other uh in our father figured course this is a top five recommendation in our in-depth stroller breakdown and by the way father figured is like our pregnancy prep course for guys get it for your husband or your partner it s a great resource instead of reading baby books now looking at the frame of the cruise V2 it looks very different from the original model and now feels a like a slim down version of the V A V2 they ve made a ton of great improvements here we re going to start with the seat which has a longer leg rest and seat back for more longevity like before it is reversible for forward or rear-facing usage and in comparison to other seats in the market up a baby is on the larger side which is great uh similar to what we see with say you know Silver Cross uh and it can carry Littles up to 50 lb in most cases kids up through age three or 4ish are going to be able to ride in and comfortably before aging out the stroller and seat weigh in at about 25 lb which is 2 lb lighter than the Vista V2 but 4 lb heavier than the original Cruise which I ve heard is you know a little bit of a deal breaker but for me it isn t that bad because first you re getting a lot more versatility here and second it still feels like a light midsize option with a compact design in comparison to others that I ve tested lifting it into your trunk is not a problem at all and it feels way easier than a full-size stroller now if you saw my review of the Vista V2 I love the canopy which is the same on the cruise uh this design is kind of becoming industry standard by unzipping and expanding one extra panel uh for extended coverage which is a switch away from the UV protection flap of the prior model uh the canopy is also height adjustable to accommodate Littles of varying ages at the bottom we ve got big improvements to the wheels as they are larger at the front and back compared to the first version and that s where some of the added weight is coming from uh they ve also added suspension from the support strut that you see here now these two improvements make the cruise arguably the best in class for terrain capability giving an easy push over Cobblestone gravel grass compared to other midsize strollers another note is with other options it s not uncommon to see some wobble at the front wheels as the axle wears over time but with the recent redesign for the V2 that s no longer an issue now even with the larger CN Wheels this thing does fold down smaller compared to the original and it s really similar to how the Vista folds it s a two-handed fold that begins by engaging the Triggers on either side of the chassis and folds down quickly it can self-stand and rests on the rubber bumpers uh of the handle bar so it doesn t you know jack up the leather the profile of the fold is among the best that I ve seen as options like uh the Silver Cross Dune kugo Mockingbird all tend to jut out a little bit more than I d like uh the cruise Folds much Slimmer in comparison and fits so much more easily in the trunk of my sedan at the bottom is a larger basket which again is reminiscent of its Big Brother the Vista uh a little different though is the brake which is a dual pedal system rather than a single pedal uh and then at the top is your handlebar which can be adjusted with one hand I think even tall parents you know 63 64 would find this pretty comfortable to push Without Really hunching over now one thing to note is all the internal mechanics that make the brake and the fold and and The Handlebar adjustments function are all wired based systems that are they re pretty small and intricate but what you get with a brand like UPA baby is a pedigree of quality and durability so these things don t break down on you over time which leads me to some of the other things beyond the cruise that UPA baby is really able to tack on to their products that you may not be thinking about that might not be so top of mind when you initially buy something like the cruise so sort of like apple you re buying into an ecosystem rather than just a one-off product for for example if you plan on traveling you can get their travel bag and register your products if any damage is incurred in transit it ll be covered with their travel safe guarantee program uh and this is something that you re not going to find very often Beyond common warranties now that s an add-on but it is something that I would definitely recommend and something that I have used in the past now other add-ons to check out their snack tray it s a great thing to swap out the handlebar with and then a personal favorite of mine is the piggyback attachment which opens up that double expansion capability I ve only ever had two issues with up a baby products and they weren t Cruise specific uh first the locking mechanism kept kind of catching on my Vista so it wouldn t really fold smoothly uh and then second the canopy of my original menu broke so you know not common issues but the point is they were rectified fast because the brand is just really good at delivering on customer service uh the menu situation actually happened while we were on vacation and they fixed it for us like on the go it was incredible uh so you know when you re buy when you re buying into a premium brand like up a baby you know it might seem really daunting and inexpensive at first uh but there is a reason why they have such a high resale value compared to other brands when you look at through you know Facebook Marketplace last thing we re going to cover here is infant adaptability which I probably should have covered this a little bit earlier sorry about that uh the toddler seat can accommodate newborns with their kit you can also get their bassinet add-on uh but our preference has just been to use their Mesa seat which adapts natively uh it s worked for us for years we ve loved it but we re very much looking forward to the release of their new Mesa V2 very soon so look for that review on this channel down the line so that s a look at the Cru V2 and some of its key features overall it s crazy how they were able to make this thing bigger but Slimmer if that makes sense this is a phenomenal option to register for now the two biggest questions that I get are do I really need a double like the Vista or can I just stick with the cruise and the second question is Cruise or mocking birth to answer the first question it s kind of difficult because we thought that we needed the Vista for you know double expansion without a shadow of a doubt we knew that we were you know planning multiple kids down the line and that this would be a great choice and it was fine it was great we we enjoyed it but in retrospect a single is probably all we really needed because as our Littles got older they didn t really use the stroller as much as I thought that they would uh if anything they were on the piggyback attachment way more than sitting in their actual seats so for that reason if I were to do this all over again I think I would have actually probably picked something like the cruise uh as a double wasn t as essential as I thought it would be uh the convenience of a of a lighter weight Slimmer body you know stroller you know it fit our lifestyle way more now for the second question Mockingbird or Cruz which is the better stroller listen I m I m a brand ambassador and advocate for Mockingbird I love the brand and I ve reviewed it on this channel plenty I ve I ve used it for years but if you re asking me which is the better stroller it s not hard to say that technically speaking up a baby has a leg up regarding overall quality and design I wouldn t say like the margin s massive but like the cruise is best in class so to answer the question that I get a lot if money wasn t a factor which would you get I would get the cruise so that s my review of the uppababy cruise V2 if you want to find it it is linked down below buying through that link help support this channel it s at no additional cost to you guys if

something different so hopefully in this video I can help you decide if the stroller is the right option for you and your Music family if you re new here I m Emily I m the stroller Mom I m a mom of

below I ll link a few different options but there is one where you can get 10 back in rewards and you can use those rewards to then buy things like the alab baby bassinet which we ll talk about in just a minute or car seat adapters so be sure to check that out the cruise is a stroller I ve wanted to review for a long time and as a firsttime parent I was so overwhelmed by all the options partly why I started the stroller mom because there was the cruise there s the Vista there s the Mocking Bird there s the Nuna there s so so many options but let me tell you the cruise is an incredible stroller and in a little bit I m going to compare it to the Vista cuz you may be trying to decide between the two of these strollers and I got some help from other moms on Instagram who have this stroller and why they went with it over the Vista so be sure to stay tuned for that the upab baby Cru retails for 699.99 and what you get for that is the stroller as you see here as well as a rain cover and a bug shield I think is what it s called Anda baby also sells a lot of attachments for their strollers so you can get a snack tray you can get a ride on board and I actually love the ride on board for this stroller because the handlebar comes out and your second child can fit in here so we ll talk about that a little bit when we talk about as your family grows but that s a really unique option you also can use it with the UPA baby Basset and I love the UPA baby bassinet I m going to show you it here in a little bit but a lot of times you can find them on Marketplace and even though the UPA baby Vista V3 is now out the Vista V2 batsin Nets are still being sold and they are an amazing option it s actually the one I have and I got mine off Marketplace so starting with the top up a baby makes such good quality products I ve said that I think about every stroller I ve reviewed of theirs and they really are top in-class in strollers I m going to say that top in- class in the stroller category they do a really good job so you have an adjustable handlebar which is one button here and it comes up and down nice leather at detailing and then there s like even little knobs here that like when you fold it so your leather bumper bar is not resting on the ground so just like a lot of good details it is a two-handed fold so there s triggers here which actually a lot of fulls siiz strollers are but we ll talk about that in just a minute and then you have the option here to recline the seat up and down so there s multiple different reclines and because of the way the seat is it does kind of have a full flat recline but because of how the seat is you do have to purchase an infant insert if you want to use the seat from birth so you may want to do that but then you can start using this seat once your baby s around 3 months old I love that they have a nice peekaboo window here in the canopy I have the Anthony color here it is so beautiful and then they have an amazing extension something I love about this canopy is they have nice mesh here so you still have that peek-aboo window when you re using the full extension and then you have it here as well and it does because of how the fabric is it does stay open even on Windy days so I ve been really happy with that and you get really good coverage something else that s super unique about UPA baby is you can wash their strollers and they even do tuneup events all across the country for their rollers so be on the lookout for that check with your local stroller retailer but that is something that is super unique that up a baby does in regards to the seatback you have a nice tall seatback and something I love about the cruise and the Vista they both have this feature is you can actually move the canopy up as your child grows this makes this stroller even more versatile so you don t have a canopy hitting your tall toddler s hedge which I have two of those and I think that that is such a nice feature the seat is plush they have no rethread harnessing and I have found that the harness adjustment on this stroller is one of the best it s so easy to do you can just pull and tighten and then they have a plastic Buckle not magnet but honestly I don t mind it they just updated the Vista V3 with magnets so I bet you they ll eventually be doing this one but honestly I ve been so happy with the Uppa baby I have their highight chair as well and it s the same mag same plastic Buckle type and it is I have no complaints the bumper Bar opens here and you have this as well it does have a zipper so you can take the leather off off which my toddler sometimes likes to do and then you have a nice adjustable footrest there s two buttons here and then there s like a little plastic part here you can fully take the seat off so you can wash it I also love that you can change it to face it towards or away from you but something that really surprised me about the Uppa babyy cruise is how low the seat was especially if someone who was just using the Vista V3 the seat definitely sits lower but up a baby cells adapters for it so for 24.99 you can buy adapters to make the seat sit higher so it s up to you if that s something you want I kind of feel like it should just be included but something to know is if you are using the seat in the parent facing mode you cannot fold the stroller this way so you have to take the seat off which honestly with modular strollers in general I tend to prefer taking the seat off before putting it in my trunk anyways so the basket on this stroller is very spacious there is that bar over that the UPA baby strollers just have but honestly L it s like a separation for me in the basket and I remember when I was researching the stroller was between this and then like the Mocking Bird and others the bar really bothered me on the research stage as someone who now uses a lot of strollers it s really not that inconvenient because basically what it is is you re putting like your diaper bag on one side it s like a divider almost which is kind of nice from like organizing I ll like put my kids cups in the front and the back so I wouldn t say that that s a huge downside on this stroller but it is something that a lot of people note and then you have like a a see-through pocket as well the basket on this stroller can hold 30 lbs that is almost unheard of like if you are someone who lives in the city and you need to get your groceries and this stroller really needs to like take you places this is going to be a great option the quality and the build on this stroller is incredible like I ve said it already but you just feel it when you push it does it s not an all all Trin stroller but it just it has some suspension it s going to be a really good city so you re going over curbs and things like that it s going to do really well and then they also have a lower foot rest down there that I used with my older kids and I was really happy with that as well before I show you the bassinet and the car seat adapters let me show you how you fold it so what you re going to do is you re going to put the seat in alignment with the bar and then you can just pull these two triggers here and fold it in half and then you just move that down so you can hold it here there s like I usually grabbed onto the handlebar when I put it in my trunk so it has a pretty compact fold and this stroller weighs 25.5 lbs so not that much lighter than the Vista which was surprising to me but it s a full-size stroller it s very comparable to a lot of its competitors and then to open it there s a little button right here you just push and then you just pull it out and then you can undo the foot rest there and then the break on this stroller is a toggle break and I found that I did not have any issues with the toggle break at all okay let me show you the bassinet so this is the up a baby bassinet it works on the stores like the menu and the Vista as well and I love that it is so versatile that if you have the cruise and then you decide to get the travel stroller like the menu you can use it with both it s sleep safe it s newborn approved it has so many nice features like this adjustable sun shade there s added air flow back here and then if you get the V3 one which will also work on the cruise V2 you have like added mesh in the seat and the new mattress and all those things but I ve been so happy with the V2 bassinet so if can find one for the right price I would totally do it a lot of parents ask me if a bassinet is worth it and I 100 think it is especially if you want to have more kids or you already have another child just having a safe place to keep your baby in a more ideal position for them is a great option and the Upp a baby bassinet is so versatile I also love that you can just push this button and pull it off so you like have your extra hand to hold and position it and I think that s a really nice option and the cruise is also compatible with a lot of different C seats I know that s something that a lot of parents ask me about it s really overwhelming like which car seats work with which stroller and the cruise all of the lineups of car seats compatible are really great so this I have the ones here for the Nuna and they re very easy to put on they re color coded and then you pop them in and then you just put the car seat on here and you have a travel system so it is also compatible with Kiko car seat which I love and then Maxi cozy and then obviously APPA baby so you have a lot of options so you can look into the different car seat and which feature works best for you so you may also be considering the upab baby Vista V3 when you re looking at the cruise one of the benefits of going with the cruise is that it s slightly smaller a little bit lighter and it is 200 savings I love that you still can use all of the same accessories and you have the rider board option well the Vista V3 gives you that option to go to a double stroller however as someone who had kids very close together that future proofing is not always all it s cracked up to be if I could go back in time you I wish I could go back and just do a single stroller and then re-evaluate as my kids got older my oldest didn t love riding in a stroller and so something like a rider board option would have worked for us or a side by-side double stroller where she could get in and out very easily so you just never know and especially as I talked to a lot of moms on Instagram the cruise was just a better option to start out with not knowing what your family is going to look like in the future I think overall I love the cruise I wish it had a one-handed fold and I wish it was just a little bit lighter but I think this is an amazing stroller for your family the quality is amazing of UPA baby the versatility with all the different car seats you can use it with or the bassinet the infant insert snack tray it s going to grow really well with your family I mean just the canopy being able to move up you ll be able to easily use this in the toddler years and it does have a really great basket if you have any additional questions

Mountain Buggy Terrain Stroller,Mountain Buggy Terrain Review,Review of the Mountain Buggy Terrain in Solus. Found that it was rather cheap for being in the higher end stroller price.,qBFNDjBaRw0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBFNDjBaRw0,19674,72,2018-02-05T05:58:39Z,all right this is my review of the mountain buggy terrain and solace it comes in at 28 pounds one year warranty comes with the bar and the little drink holders that are a nice little bonus but other than that to surmise my review and you don t to hear the whole thing is it s not worth the price go with the urban glide to or a Bob stroller first off starting from the front to the back comes with the wheel that is lockable in the front and back orientation you have to screw this all the way down and unscrew it all the way don t catch if you don t unscrew it exactly as much it has a little bar right here that can help adjust the tire from left to right to kind of make it track more straight but you have to undo this and then adjust this tighten back up and everything seems to have sealed bearings so that s a good thing the front tire you can t use a regular bike pump to get in here you have to get a little car compressor and stick it on there to pump it up they don t give you a pump and nothing else will really fit in here unless you have a 90-degree elbow attachment inflate the tires to 20 psi regular little grooves a little bit larger set tires in the front all this is aluminum so that s nice and sturdy I m moving up to the seat it has a little slide out that helps it so you can have a nice little notch and the legs on the ride and push it back in it goes down flat has a little handle bar Pat it all the way around kind of a soft fabric on it a little foam inside of it flips all the way up and down so you can get the kid in and out so my taller kid might hit their head you can t really detach this anywhere you actually have to like really pull that apart to get it back on and then snap it back in the seat is reversible and it comes out so it can be washed it is not that well padded its kind of firm like most other ones the adjustments for the seat have to be taken out and thread it through each time it has a regular five-point safety harness one button presses to open this up there s no little protector in front of here so as your kid gets older they can probably just hit the button and pop right out while you re running has two little pockets right here meshed for storage put some snacks on the go or their little drink bottle as you can see the cable for the break runs right by here so they can fidget with that too while you re running not the best idea other than that the canopy has a little fold-out Sun Visor and it goes back in a little zipper or a rain or a Sun protector can strap on the front it is a follow the Sun canopy which means that it can go all the way down to the front and protect the Sun while you re running straight I ll go back up but as you see it s really wobbly doesn t really stay together very well sometimes it ll stay in an uneven spot but you can snap it to here to help hold it together has a nice little peekaboo window with magnetic clips so you don t have the velcro tearing however they didn t put anything to secure it up here so if you want to run and be able to see through the peekaboo window it ll just blow right back in the wind also like I said this is just so flimsy just like a umbrella in the wind that was turned inside out it just doesn t seem to hold very well together also about the peekaboo window I m five nine and this is my vantage point when I m running I can t even see in so I d have to use this to kind of peek in to actually look I have to go all the way over the top so not really functional for that purpose and unless you re six foot three this is maybe the stroller for you has nice rubber grips back here a good idea durable got little grooves inside of it so sweat can kind of go out however they didn t make it so the rubber actually grips to the bar so your hand just rotates got the bike style brake nice little break has to so each one is operated at the same time but as you can hear next a nice little honking noise you can hear that very well but I put grease on it to help coming down it sounded like a goose honking whenever he first got it now that s about as as good as it gets also these brakes dust can get them in easily you have to take them out and keep clinging I also hear a grinding noise while you re going the brake simply just flick it down and you back up to lock it come on luck I m sorry the axle is the one thing I have wrong with this brake as you see in the upright position the actual brake wire runs lower than the axle so if you re trying to go over some rocks or something like that this would hit first instead of like other strollers where it s either at level with it or it s above it like a bob and when you flick it down obviously you now have all this in the way but this is how you undo the wheels you press this in and the wheel pops right off they give you 12 inch and 16 inch wheels I ve never needed to use the 12-inch ones as you can see on this side this little piece right here is already falling out as opposed to this one this little snap has broken off it helps snap this little part of the carrier to helps hold it it broke it in the first week also no storage under here no vent back here so depending what client you re in that could be a pro or a con it has the two adjust things so instead of pulling one lever you have to pull both it does lay all the way flat and goes up to about 70 degrees at its maximum so that s a good thing to water bottle holders it just kind of velcro one right by those is the attachment point so you can remove this entire cover I ll show you in a second with the baby carrier on you take it all off also with the baby carrier on this piece can t be there because it does not go over to protect the baby so you have no front cover as some strollers will allow you can t even put the baby carrier in here with this because this piece doesn t drop down so you have to take the whole thing off just to get the carrier in here other than that coming up over here the shocks only have about one inch of travel also they put the shocks at the top rather than the bottom so you get more wobble because of that little hinge right here as opposed to the play being down here also they re really rigid which can be good I guess for running but when you re going over slow terrain and everything you need more of that soft expansion over rocks and stuff it translates into your child I had 100 expedition that had about the same amount of vibration to my kid that had no shocks as opposed to this six 700 mountain buggy but like I said it s just wobbly plastic well than that nice aluminum has a little carrier underneath here mesh cover it doesn t really protect anything from falling out too bad because this front part never will close as well as this is just mesh so at the tire flood or water if you run through a puddle will come right up underneath there on top of all your belongings so it s nice but you know that foolproof few little zipper pockets to go with as for other storage on the side of here you have two zipper pockets and equated headphone jack if you want to run with the wire coming all the way up to you most of us have bluetooth but that s about it as for folding and unfolding it babe I will show you that it s kind of a simple mechanism you just grabbed right underneath the seat pressing this button and then you twist and it folds all the way together you have to press it or else it won t lock up and then also you have to fold the handlebar down in order to get it to stand up good so they will stand up on its own but you have to remember to do this beforehand undoing it is the same way press it in rotate and pull it back out so in a nutshell that s the mountain buggy terrain I would just say it is not worth the price point maybe for three hundred three hundred fifty dollars it s a good Mountain you know the good stroller but for all intents his purpose of calling a mountain buggy I don t think it can actually go over anything mountainous and terrain it also is not very well built comes with a one-year warranty most other people have ten year or five year warranties and like I said with the amount of Parts I have these pieces that I ve already collected falling off of it already so not very quality built so I m gonna go ahead and strip it down and show you the lovely chicco keyfit stroller adapter that doesn t work very well this is the mountain buggy terrain without the car seat on or without the child seat on with the car seat adapter on for the chicco keyfit nice feature that it comes right off as I said earlier snap here snap here and a little tie that goes around and two little buckles on either side the key fit adapter just snaps on to the side like the handle bar however when it comes these things are really far down in there I had a priming up just to get my car seat on there I was having to Ram it all the way in I wouldn t even do that with my child and still it s kind of precarious with my child in there of how it works as you can also see it does damaged my sides already a little bit but put it in all you got to do let s get it to line up it doesn t go in very easy here the two clicks and as you saw I would never really want to do this my kid inside of it pretty sturdy but it stopped wobbly because the shocks being up here makes it a little more excessive the wobble to get it out down again that s pretty much it with the buggy adapter on there as I said with my review is that the mountain buggy good in theory but not very good customer service not very big quality good quality product I ve contacted them a week ago and they still haven t replied to the issues with the connector the issues with the brakes squealing the issues with the rubber moving all these issues that have come off of a 600 product and they can t even contact me in a week to kind of help me out and walk me through maybe if I need to change or modify my brakes or something different but like I said altogether I ll be doing a review of the Chuli which I ve investigated which it s a really great product a really great warranty only thing that it didn t have that this one has is the little seat post that comes out and follow the Sun canopy but other than that it s a way better built product way better warranty and it s only four hundred fifty dollars on backcountry dot-com so and it has the cover on the bottom of it to protect your stuff all the way it does have a foam handlebar but that s okay it does I like this kind of brake better the chili has a brake that you actually have to rotate with your hand back which is a little unnatural versus just having this to kind of throttle and you kind of have to just rotate so pros and cons each one but I d say that this one is definitely getting box backed up and sent back because it is not worth the money it s my own personal opinion some people love it it gets four and a half stars I personally can t see why because as my experience has been subpar from right when I open the box it literally had breaks at honked louder than the geese that lived down there to woke my child up from a deep sleep it also annoyed the ever-loving out of my wife where I don t even use the brakes anymore and things are falling off of it it s just it s just a product that doesn t really fit plus the longevity it only has a 55 pound weight capacity whereas the Trulie and the Bob go up to 75 so you ll get more use out of it and longevity it s just like I said it s heavier by three pounds compared to both of the other models and it s just just a lot less for a lot more so let me know what you think and hopefully the next week I ll be able to show you the truly urban glide to 2018 model and it s a really really nice stroller this one sucks you
Mountain Buggy Terrain Stroller,What to Look for When Buying a Used Mountain Buggy Terrain,"To support our work, visit PLEASE SUBSCRIBE! Subscribing helps preserve the ...",WDEnjpvsZOQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDEnjpvsZOQ,12311,58,2014-06-21T13:57:41Z,this is the Mountain Buggy terrain and it s quite popular these days because it s seen as a jogging stroller and it has certain functions that allow it to be used as a jogging stroller um it can have a lot of the same sorts of problems as the urban jungle model and I just wanted to go over the chassis and kind of point out some of the areas where you might have problems and suggest some solutions for maintenance and for fixing these problems and so on as well as what to expect from this stroller so beginning with the front wheel on mountain buggy this is often a problem actually any three wheel stroller that has a swivel front wheel often has problems with the mechanism the mechanism is made mostly of metal so it s pretty sturdy but you are going to want to pop off this top with a small screwdriver and oil in here and also from time to time tighten the nut which is under there in order to um keep this Fork tight this one s a bit loose now you can see so I m going to be tightening that afterwards another area of problem commonly with the newer Mountain Buggy strollers in particular is the ball bearings and so with the front wheel the ball bearing is in here and you ll want to oil that regularly as well you ll also want to oil through the center of the wheel where the axle goes if you don t for a while and it starts to rust it can be very hard to remove the axle and fix problems later this will make eventual repairs more expensive moving towards the back side of the stroller the other common area that has a problem with the terrain in particular is the hand brake system so if we remove this wheel you can see that the handbrake system runs down to this rubber um caliper that pushes up on this metal disc here and the problem is that there is a little bit of wiggle room with the axle as well as as I said before common problems with the ball bearings and this means that the wheel when it s in place tends to lean forward onto the rubber caliper and it makes a winding noise As you move so this is a problem that s just going to occur with this stroller and the best thing you can do to alleviate this is to not expect very much from how hard the handbrake will work if you keep the hand brake tight enough so that when you re going down a hill it will slowly come to a stop then you re fine then the rubber caliper will be far enough from the wheel that it won t make that noise but if you expect a sudden stop then this is not the stroller for you because the brake system is not designed to handle that in addition if you notice that the brakes are starting to get a bit tight you ll want to oil inside the brake wires and you can find the the several joints along the brake wire system where you can unscrew things and spray a little bit of spray grease like WD-40 down inside and that will fix those problems otherwise besides the hand brakes and the front wheel um this chassis is going to more or less get the same sorts of problems as the urban jungle in general it s a very good chassis it s uh made of relatively quality materials and very simple design but there are a number of plastic parts and these can break so in that case one would need to order new parts and replace them but that s relatively easy sometimes you ll have to drill out a rivet here and there but otherwise it s pretty straightforward as usual if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below and if you have any problems specifically related to the stroller also contact us and we ll try to help you thank you
Mountain Buggy Terrain Stroller,Running Buggy comparison Thule Urban Glide and Mountain Buggy Terrain,"Running Buggies.com review, by mum Wendy, of the Thule Urban Glide s features v the Mountain Buggy Terrain.",yKQLTVHMk7k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKQLTVHMk7k,20685,103,2016-06-08T21:08:29Z,hi I m Wendy from running buggies and I m going to do a quick review of the Tula Urban Glide versus the Mountain Buggy terrain um both are fantastic swivel wheel running buggies which are designed for off-road and are pretty brilliant um but they have different features which I ve just thought um I should highlight for you so let s start um one of the key differences is the height you can see here the um height of the Tula versus the height of the terrain um because the handles are adjustable both with some buttons on the inside it means that they really are suitable for all different heights of Runners but I would say it means the terrain lends itself really to um a super tall Runner um guys over 6t or guys 3 6t um the terrain is also slightly heavier in terms of the frame uh the Tula is lighter both have got safety straps and um slightly different um seat inclines so the terrain has a completely Li flat seat you can see here which you just adjust using these straps oh excuse any noises there we go and the tuler um not completely fly not completely flat but not far off and then you just push it up using that mechanism there both have got 16in rear wheels and 12in front wheels um but the terrain comes with 12in rear wheels as well which is their free throwing um which can be quite good in terms of of going around town they both have great storage underneath and covers which mean that your valubles don t jump out when you re running on a bubbly track but the terrain is just a mesh one you ve got some pockets in the back of both the brake is slightly different so you can see here on the terrain the brake has a cover on it so I m going pull it this way it s quite quiet and um it s quite easy to do which is great if you re wearing flipflops or something the um Tula is just more of a metal structure and is a little bit noisy which has been frustrating for some moms dads who have sleeping babies the wheels are both really easy to pop off you just push this in and then slide it off and then in the terrain you just use that button there um the terrain has some water bottle holders which um also have some little pockets in terms of seeing your baby while they re asleep they both have two different ways of doing that so the terrain has this um peep hole where and it s completely um clear perpect as you can see with magnets which are a little bit quieter and this the back poppers on here so you can just lift it forward and have a look which is what I actually end up doing on the tuler having a look like that because um with the way that they Design This there s like a grid here and I think it makes it quite hard to look in it might be so the sunlight doesn t get in their eyes um but you can roll this one back which tuck it under there which you can t do on the terrain and it has a really fantastic sun canopy um which is a bit provides a bit more coverage than the terrain there s a zip here which rain covers and sun covers on the Mountain Buggy attached to and if I pull this back we can have a look inside so you ve got a bumper bar which is fantastic for hanging toys both have got great little pockets on the inside for snacks and toys um one of the really fantastic things about the terrain is this seat here which is super easy to get out and means it s washable and you ll find that you re giving your little on snacks to keep them happy while you re running but then your buggy can end up getting a bit crusty so that is a really good idea in terms of the straps they very easy to adjust they have these clips like that which you slide up and down and then it uh has a fiveo safety harness both do but the guys at um Mountain Buggy decided to do a separate one which Just Clips in and then you obviously press that and they will pop out jewry s out on how handy that is the idea is that you re not having to wrestle a little arm in um actually putting four in can be a bit of a faff so not so sure about that one on the tuler you can see got the snack Pockets here and um this is what the um the harness looks like you just press those buttons in and that pops out and then this is how you adjust the straps there um both have got some front wheels that lock very easily you can see the locking mechanism here here which is quite straightforward and then the locking mechanism here on the terrain both collapse very easily you can see um this button which you just push in and twist and then suddenly it s collapsed and it s the same on the tuler with even with instructions so pushed across and then twist like so and when they collapsed you can probably see they re very similar in size um I would store them the other way around and um fold the handle in that s my top tip so um those are the key differences key features they vary slightly in price as well the mountain bik terrain is more expensive but both fantastic buggies so pick the features you like and happy buggy running from Wendy at running buggies um mom so please support me

can adjust the the rear incline decline with this just pull the straps out and then if you want to um lower it you just pull it it s really simple and then we have the wheel lock in the back this rear one so whenever you re moving and then you need a stock and take your hands off the stroller completely you want to lock that in place to make sure the bag is there s also a front lock as well we don t use it a whole lot but it kind of like locks the front wheel in place as well and one really cool feature about this stroller is how much storage you actually have so back here you know i showed you the flap that you roll up it s actually got several compartments you have a zipper you could put in you know your wallet your keys your phone or whatever and then you also have two side pockets you can play like your water bottle baby bottles what else and um over here at the bottom is the really cool function it s a really big space but um more interesting is the front you can actually access it on this tab right there so whenever you re out grocery shopping or whatever you can feel free to you know put items there make sure you pay for it though don t forget that and then one secret thing that we found by accident actually i ll show you with the uh the baby car seat you can actually do front or rear we actually do a rear because we like to see kinsley and just lock it in place come on back here you have this extra pocket right here we actually found it by accident because kinsley was kicking her blankets and her pacifiers and whatever so it s extra space if you need it and then you can adjust the handlebars there s two red buttons on the left and the right but just kind of hold it push it down Music and it s really cool function with the canopy on the car seat it works with the stroller so especially during the pandemic right now you want to be as safe as possible kind of just do that like that and the baby s fully protected and then whenever you need you know extra ventilation just pull this up Music yeah so i m going to show you guys how we actually transition from inside the car to the stroller it s really cool you want to start by pulling these red levers again on the side up so you can grab the handle and then the front actually has a red lever as well pretty close everything all the buttons are pretty much red so it s pretty easy to see come on over here and the system comes with a base it s pretty easy to set up i m not going to go into it but you pretty much just click it into place that s it that s what s so convenient about this and then i like to put the handlebar back down and then put kinsley in i ll show you guys later let me show you how we put away the stroller into our car we take it everywhere we go now just because it s so convenient and yeah we can take kensei with us so i want to start by hitting this button right there and it s super simple if my wife has to take kinsley by herself she can do it just push the button and pull this up Music go straight into the trunk now i m going to show you guys how to assemble everything it s pretty straightforward as well just uh make sure you pull this black lever and it kind of folds and you just lift make sure the wheel lock is in place grab the handlebar is up and pull the red button back so i m going to show you the functions on the actual car seat so you can adjust the back depending on how you know how big the baby is and then this is actually for when the baby s young and it s like a head support make sure the head doesn t rattle but you can take this off when the baby gets older and there s actually two settings for the buckle as well so i m gonna go ahead and grab kinsley and show you how it looks like all right kenzie here we go lift this up i know she doesn t really like this process but once she s in she s usually pretty good take that arm strap good honey Music okay now that she s in place i m going to show you guys how it looks like when she s fully covered bear with me kinsley Music do that she s totally covered and then when she wants to see mommy and daddy Music usually she s not this fussy but that s pretty much it so we really really

Britax B-Lively Stroller,NEW 2019 Britax B-Lively Travel System Demo,"Cruise smooth with the new B-Lively 2019 stroller, featuring all-wheel suspension and a lightweight design for everyday strolling.",pcGTf7wOAGc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcGTf7wOAGc,107524,259,2019-01-01T15:21:24Z,Music the V lathi stroller comes with its own clicking bow adapters comes with the stroller so you don t have to pay for any adapter assembly makes for an easy transition from car seat to stroller when you re using any of our infant car seats they match right up with the stroller without having to purchase any additional adapters it s great if you re in the city and your baby s sleeping you can close both canopies and we have a little beef Cole right here which is great for mom to peek in and see the baby or dad or if you just want to like black it all out you can close it like that and they have a nice little nap so that s how it s used as a travel system we have two separate travel systems that you can purchase one is 3.99 including the be safe 35 and then if you purchase it with a be safe 35 elite and if you choose to purchase the be lively with the be save ultra that will be 429 so a little bit about the smaller this is an upgrade from our b-agile which has been in the market since 2010 and this be lively just came out this summer people are loving it becoming one of our best selling strollers again for these simple facts I m just gonna go right cut right to the change and show you the fold that s what usually the biggest question is for most parents when they re shopping for a new stroller and it s a one-hand fold so you can actually be holding the car seat when you re folding your stroller there s a little button on the side right here that you re just going to click in and then you pull the handle up and you re off and walking so very convenient not only is it an easy full but you can see how compact it is so it s going to fit in the back of pretty much any vehicle that you re packing and then again it s super lightweight so it does fit in that lightweight category and three really important things when you re looking for a stroller and especially for a travel stroller or one that you re going to be in and out of the car with a lot so it opens right back now we re going to walk through some of the more convenient features on the stroller such as having access to your basket so right here we actually have a larger basket than the be agile and you can access it a little bit easier because instead of having a metal pole right here that connects you can actually push down the fabric to get your diaper bag in now if your child sleeping in the reclined position back here sometimes it can be difficult to get into that basket so we ve opened it up from the front as well so you can just open that up and you have access to the basket from here now if you need extra pockets which you didn t have in the b-agile we added a zipper cap so when you go to fold that stroller you don t want everything falling out so you can add your purse I m sorry so you can add your wallet your keys and maybe your cell phone right here in the zipper pouch if you re on the go pretty quickly so we re gonna fold it nothing s gonna fall out we do have to open pouches here which you can actually fit a nice water bottle if you don t have a stroller organizer so it does hold a water bottle and some other items if you wanted to now if you re out in the Sun you want an oversized can be this one has a very large canopy it s going to protect your child that is sitting in the seat or if you re in the travel system mode and lastly you want a stroller that s going to fit your infant all the way up to 55 pounds whether they re sleeping or sitting upright and so one of the ways that we can make them more comfortable is changing the reclined position and it s very easy on our protect strollers and that you just hold these two stand apart like that and then you can see that the seat is more upright and it is a more upright seat than the stroller of two years ago so we have made some adjustments to that if you have heard about that now to recline it you just squeeze the two grace buttons right here and pull it back down very simply so it transitions very easily and this is the B lightly

Peg Perego YPSI Stroller,Peg Perego Ypsi Double Stroller UPDATED 2023,"Welcome to our comprehensive assembly tutorial for the Peg Perego Double Stroller! In this step-by-step video guide, we will walk ...",c2HYLx0JjL0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2HYLx0JjL0,6435,56,2023-05-28T23:30:22Z,hey guys Welcome to our updated 2023 video for our Peg Perego Ipsy 2 uh travel system video what I m going to be showing you today is how to attach the pieces to make the stroller a double stroller so you can use the car seat with a toddler seat or both toddler seats or whatever configuration you really like for both of your babies so here are the first two pieces these are going to be your two top pieces up here what you re going to want to take note of is where where the uh I use the screws or the sticker here that s going to be your inside piece it s going to face the inside and then what you also want to take mind of is when you re putting these two pieces together you need to leave the stroller in the closed position otherwise it s not going to go go into place so like with my other video if you ve seen it if you haven t goes if you haven t seen it go back in our Channel and you ll see it the assembling and unboxing of the stroller um you ll see that you know when I talk about putting it in you hear a click and then that s when you know it s fully in so that s your full first piece then you re gonna put in your second piece remember screws are on the inside here our little guy he just woke up so boom you got both pieces you re good to go now what we can do is open the stroller and we re gonna put second pieces in now what you want to take note of here is that there s this piece or the bottom basket is connected to you see you can see those pieces right there and there s also these screw pieces right here which it s also attached to this one came out but that s good so you can see it let s just go ahead and put that back in there make sure both sides are in why I m telling you to take note of that is because these bottom pieces that s where they re going to attach so it s going to go right in between those screws and again sticker goes facing inward and then screws go facing inward so what we just learned recently because we ve been using it wrong but you know you learn is that it doesn t go on the first screw it goes on the second screw down here and essentially the best way to remember it is just put it butt it up down here so you re going to take this you re just going to slip this little red piece there I m going to snap it in so just move it down so it sits in between the screw right there boom you hear that nice little snap and then this is gonna close here let me make sure I don t have the brake you got to watch this uh little brake line right here so you re just going to want to move it let me just take this back out so I can assemble it I can t see from that angle too well so let me just take this back out I m going to make sure I get it so that way I go in between the little brake line and it sits nice and flush then now boom nice easy so that s another thing that we found out just watch that brake line where you re putting it on it s only on that one side that s the right side of the stroller and then the next one super easy again just put it in between the um the bottom Carriage part and then you just move it boom set in between screw nice click there you go you got your attachment set up what we were doing wrong we were putting it higher up and then we couldn t close the stroller and for some reason we were like why would they make a product like this it makes no sense well sorry Peg Perego we just didn t get the instructions for it so now if you notice you can close it stays closed you can put it in your car your SUV hopefully you have an SUV it s a little harder to fit in the car with these sticking out a little bit further but um yeah so now you got your double stroller set up and you can configure it to any way you like now please Peg Perego is known for this their instructions are only pictures it makes it a little difficult whenever you re putting on the seats or the car seat or the toddler seats pay attention to these stickers don t ever put on the seat without the other seat being there because it s going to cause it to be unbalanced and then your baby can fall over so put the car seat here and then not have us there because then it s it s just gonna roll back over because it it s not sitting on the center point of the stroller you know keeping it to the ground so let me go ahead and show you what it looks like with the the car seat and the toddler seat she s gonna go here grab this now you can put it you know facing anyway we usually do it like this for our little baby we like to see him when we re walking so this is your first one remember I said don t leave it just like this if you have the attachments on because it ll easily tip over like all the weight is here so you don t you don t want that you have to have the other seat on to counterbalance the weight so go ahead get open the taller seat now you see we have two toddler seats please note that you do have to buy another toddler seat when you re buying the attachments so that s that s part of another expense I don t know what the cost of it is but we ll put it there um we ll put it there below there will be a link there any of the links that you guys find below there ll be affiliate links so they will help support us to be able to keep continue uh making more videos like this for you guys so here um you put this on I leave it a little folded so I can just get it in a little easier um then you lift that up and boom so now now you know toddler s good baby s good you can also you know recline it up I m assuming you guys know how to recline the seats if you don t it s this um this little thing right here so it folds and then when you fold it open you hit this latch you can recline forward or backwards okay so that s car seat and toddler seat toddler you can put it the other way if you want I m not sure why you would want to in this configuration but I mean it s it s definitely doable do pay attention to that as well these bars are here so make sure you kind of like dip it down a little bit this way dip it down and then you can put the toddler seat on and then boom and then again they can recline if you need them recline obviously These Bars will stop it from going any further than that but you don t it doesn t go any further than that anyway so it s perfectly fine okay let s go ahead and take the car seat off and we ll put both toddler seats on let s go ahead and grab this and get the other toddler seat so we usually leave it a little folded to put it on so you know I ll just take it apart about about this much see so I can just kind of sit in easier and find both sides boom wow you re set up for two topics or you know when babies a little bit older and let me unlock this so you can see it take a break off there you go you got both both toddler seats like I said you can do multiple configurations you know if you want them to see each other go ahead and you know as you see me picking these up they are very light my wife can easily handle this um these seats the stroller so now they can see each other you know they can laugh and giggle and do all their stuff that they like to do together um and then here s the other way go ahead and tell me a bit oh okay and then so when you have these configurations when you have this seat up here you ll notice that the handlebars they kind of don t really I mean there s space I mean you can recline up some but you know it s it s a little bit tight here what you do you take the telescoping handle move it up now we re on the shorter side so the only time you ll see it up this way is when we have the seat like this and this gives you a little bit more room a little bit more space especially if you know you have them up and then again they can recline if they need to um so yeah that s the setup this is you know how we re doing it now we have a a small uh Kia Forte sedan so you know the space in the trunk it s a little bit tighter but it does fit it does fit with the attachments and if you do need to do just one seat at a time you only have one child with you you re gonna have to take off the attachments like I said it s not very difficult it s pretty easy you know you hit these two latches right here on these toddler seats if you don t have it yet and you re just watching this video trying to figure out if you re you know this stroller s for you you hit these two you kind of push them up folds over nice and light has a handle for you to carry it and you just put it to the side so if you re doing only one child number you cannot use it like this because it s it s off balance so you re going to do the same thing you re going to go ahead hit the two latches fold it over nice and easy take off the seat so now if we re doing one child you know you go ahead and say all right gotta take this off pull it up and out simple up and out done a couple seconds now remember these to put them on you got to keep it closed to take them off you got to close it because it s not going to come off even as much as I want to it s locked in there so go ahead if you don t know how to close it let s go ahead and put this down as well Applause two latches both sides take it down take this little lever right here your locking lever go ahead grab it and squeeze and then just stay right behind it boom closed it ll stand up on its own because the handles reach the floor and then now you can easily take this off and you re done you got back your single stroller put these back in the trunk or whatever storage you have it for nice one hand open you re back to a single stroller for just one kid you know if you just need to run to the grocery store the other one s with Grandma or wifey or with Dad there you go it s all set up that s the updated video if you guys have any questions please let us know down in the comments um you ll see the links again

Peg Perego YPSI Stroller,Peg Perego Ypsi Review MadeForMums,Our MFM reviewer has been testing the Peg Perego Ypsi pushchair with her 5-month-old daughter.,v9QVH5IKEjg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9QVH5IKEjg,29723,55,2019-07-05T11:45:41Z,I m rakeesha and I ve been testing Peg Perego s new Ypsi pram system from made for mums I ve been using both the bassinet and the seat unit with my five month old daughter first I m going to talk about the bassinet or carry car as a no song we ll call it I really like the different apron for this it can attach to the hood using tiny velcro tabs to help give your little one some privacy when they re sleeping or when you prefer for strangers not to peek in my favorite feature of the bassinet is the adjustable backrest it can set to three different positions included the recommended light a flat position but when she s not sleepy or sleeping I keep it on the most upright position so my daughter can have a better view of the world another great feature is the hood which is a really good size and offers UPF 50 plus protection it also has a flip-out ventilation panel to allow plenty of airflow through the baby I do in the warmer months so baby doesn t overheat the seat can be placed in both parent facing and world facing position as my baby is still quite young I prefer using the parent facing option for now in both ways the cecum clients have three different positions sitting relaxing and resting my favorite feature of the seat unit is the hood it offers a UPF 50 plus protection and also has a zipper extension the zipper extension is really cool when my little one is sleeping it helps block out noise and also sunlight I really loved the size of the basket I can fit lots in it including my nursing pillow which is pretty bulky the size expand a little for maximum storage I don t have any fear of anything slipping out the ipsy handlebar can be adjusted to three different heights so whoever was pushing it where its grandparents mom dad maybe older siblings they should be able to find a height that is comfortable for them I also want to highlight just how great it is to push and maneuver it tackles multiple surfaces with ease thanks to its great suspension as the wheels are mounted on 12th all bearings the roads and pavements now my home are pretty uneven and bumpy but the ipsy takes them on like a pro
Evenflo Pivot Xpand Stroller,Evenflo Pivot XPAND Stroller Review Best Budget Travel System?,This is a review of the Evenflo Pivot XPAND modular travel system which includes the SafeMax infant car seat. At only 399 for the ...,iENDVe9SDC4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iENDVe9SDC4,158322,1369,2021-06-29T17:00:31Z,Music hey guys andrew here with dad verb thank you so much for helping us get to a hundred thousand subscribers if you do find this video helpful hit that like button down there now i ve highlighted the even flow pivot expand a few times in the past on this channel often calling it one of the better low to mid tier stroller options it offers all the function and versatility from high-end full-size brands at a price point of only 3.99 for the entire travel system so what we ll do is get a full picture of the stroller and see how it stacks up against similarly priced options like mockingbird and the maxi cosy zelia since a lot of parents tend to narrow it down to those two options pretty often even more so than guys like you know baby jogger or the upper cruise let s go ahead and dive into it from the top the handlebar has a great feel i know that leather is a trend that most parents are going for but you know i know i don t mind this personally i like the feel of the soft foam uh it s got great grip and i feel like i ve got good control of the stroller but i can see it getting some wear and tear marks pretty easily over long periods of time the height adjustment is similar to mockingbird where it hinges rather than slides up and down like upper baby options moving down along the frame are the triggers for the fold now before it folds down i ve learned that you should adjust the handle so that it goes all the way up so that it can self self-stand when folded the fold is pretty smooth though it s not the most compact but you know it s serviceable it can still squeeze into the trunk of any compact car just fine the crossbar of the seat does need to be removed though now personally i don t like that you have to make any sort of like adjustment uh before it goes into the trunk so i wish that you could just go straight into the trunk with it because you have to take that that crossbar off it is a bit of an inconvenience in my opinion unless it is being loaded into like a larger suv or a van that s not really an issue this isn t isolated to evenflow by the way i mean mockingbird does have you do the same thing with removing the bar for the open you pull the latch out rather than pushing in like a baby strollers now this is a subtle thing but that motion alone makes for an easier open with the vista i always feel like i have to lay the stroller down and then press the lever to get it open with the expand it s a tiny bit easier to get it set up just because of that subtle way that the lever unlocks the thing with many other brands though is that at least one of those functions whether it s the handlebar adjustment or the fold a lot of them can be done with one hand with the expand you have to use both hands for both functions so not as convenient there gotta ding it a little bit but on the plus side peep that free cup holder that you can attach on the right side if you leave it on all the time just note that you may experience some bending on it uh when stored in a trunk it ll it ll probably get dinged around a bit now moving down the seat in the canopy check all the boxes but nothing is really going to like wow you hear the material it does feel like it s lacking a little bit of that gusto that i want from a comfort standpoint you know i think your child is going to sit in it just fine but you can tell that the cushioning is just a little bit thinner compared to some of those premium options and lacks a little bit more rigidity it s got a basic three-point harness that s easy to adjust so you know no issues there and it s got that padded crossbar which unfortunately does have to either be completely on or off altogether you can t just like leave it hanging half off uh making that a little bit more of an inconvenience whereas mockingbird lets you do that the footrest at the bottom can be adjusted similarly to the handle but for me the buttons do stick a little bit uh once i get the buttons pressed down it often feels like you know i want like a third hand to move the footrest sometimes i ll just use my head um i feel like that could be a little bit smoother especially in comparison to other brands now the canopy is alright it offers a peep window at the top but no magnets to keep it down so it can tend to flail a little bit in the wind so ding there not major though i d say the main downside is just a lack of an extended sun shade which i m sure some parents might be a little bit bummed about so if you re walking west on a late evening stroll uh there s a good chance that that sun is gonna be dipping down coming into your child s face a little bit and might be a bit bothersome so up to this point the stroller seems like a pretty simple budget friendly option that s you know not outstanding but still a very serviceable pick that many families are going to get great use out of but where it shines is its ability to expand to a double without the use of adapters versatility that is what parents are going to love here to get it into a double you start by popping off the seat and sliding the adapters up the frame next at the bottom toward the front of the basket is a button to release the lower adapters they pop out easy and with the seconds you can expand to a double hence its name without having to track down and snap on adapters which i love just a heads up though lining up the car seat and toddler seat to snap into the stroller was way more difficult than other strollers that i ve used it definitely took a little bit more time for me to get used to that uh i feel like that could be improved if they ever did like a v2 of the stroller you can make multiple configurations both forward and rear-facing and with evenflo s rider board it can carry up to three kids which is great haven t used that but might be a worthy pickup i did mention it comes with a safe max car seat but if you want it can adapt to others including the kiko key fit greco snug ride click connect and and more so go ahead and check out the description for more on compatibility with infant car seats the last thing i ll hit on here is yet another way evenflo added even more versatility with innovative design that s how the toddler seat can actually become a bassinet so that s yet another add-on that you need not worry about i will say though that my experience using it as a vest and it is lacking a bit so i can t say too much more on that but if there are any existing users out there that have thoughts on that please share that below moving down the storage capacity of the basket is great the back is a little bit more shallow but can easily accommodate large diaper bags and more it is specked at a max payload of 10 pounds but it took a 25 pound dumbbell pretty well at the back is your single pedal brake nothing too crazy there it works great but let s move on to the push now unlike mockingbird s rubber wheels the expands are foam filled plastic cruiser tires now these wheels they re going to wear on you a little bit and won t be able to accommodate as much terrain so cobblestone gravel and dirt paths they re not going to be ideal environments for this there is no locking mechanism to keep the the front wheel straight so it ll always have that swivel some don t really care about that uh but just something to note overall i d say that the push is smoother than you know say the maxi cosi zelia but definitely not as smooth as your nunas of the world also the stroller is on the heavier side at about 28 pounds so when fully loaded as a double you ll definitely feel more resistance on turns compared to strollers with wheels boasting a larger circumference at the back so that s a look at the stroller i ve got it linked below buying through that link by the way help support this channel it s at no additional cost to you but the question is should you actually click through that link and buy the stroller let s go ahead and unpack that a little bit if you re the kind of person that s like you know this is what i can afford i don t really care i just need a stroller right to push baby from point a to point b the expand is gonna be a solid pickup for you you know i d say for its price point it ll be the best that you can get it s not without its issues though while a ton of parents have had great experiences with it i ve also heard from a good many that have basically said that you kind of get what you pay for and it ll cost you more and trying to get it fixed or parts replaced and they regret not just making the jump to a premium option right from the start so from a quality standpoint the higher cost of you know a baby jogger up a cruise or you know nuna mix and other options like that they re going to deliver on better comfort materials durability and then sometimes design but what about the one that i m asked about the most one of my personal favorites mockingbird if you re asking me which is a better purchase i would say that the expand is probably going to give you a lot more value you re getting so much for such a good price that said mockingbird is definitely a better stroller to me it s a lot more durable and pushes and feels like a premium stroller while still being under that 500 mark you re still spending a little bit more because you can t buy it as an entire you know travel system but i think it is worth it while still not pushing up past that 700 mark that s all i ve got for you guys

Evenflo Pivot Xpand Stroller,Evenflo Pivot Xpand Review - Convert Single to Double Stroller in Seconds!,"Disclaimer Product was provided free from Evenflo in exchange for this video, and there are some affiliate links below, but all ...",DZISLUHtX00,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZISLUHtX00,159351,1068,2018-08-20T20:12:44Z,I am here today to introduce the latest single - double conversion stroller this is the Evenflo pivot expand it retails for 400 for the single stroller and a car seat and then the second seat retails for 120 so basically you get the whole single - double conversion stroller for about 5 20 which is a great deal both seats are infant compatible you just unhooked the bottom and push the seat down and becomes a bassinet both of this seats are good up to 55 pounds which is huge my almost 6 year old still fits in there I can probably fit in there - like 7 what is really cool about this conversion stroller is that it converts without any extra pieces all you need is that 2nd seat but the frame is ready to go as a single or double everything is included in the frame you just like flip and pull up and snaps it s so easy no tools no parts to lose there s 22 configurations but some of the way that they re facing they won t be able to reclaim which is a bit frustrating but once we figure out which positions you can have your kids in for the ride and if they re gonna be napping or whatever you just figure it out and you keep them in those configurations this is the stroller and it s a great touch easy to pop up of course not quite so easy when you have two kids in there it does have a ride on board which is extra I haven t seen it I don t think it s available yet but it simply snaps on super easy I ll be getting that to review so check back in the us-japan fam on Instagram Facebook I ll be popping it up there it comes with a cup holder that just kind of slides on the hook and that recline on these is it easy one hand reply with you just pull the lever and it reclines completely flat and then here is where you unsnap behind the footrest and then push down and now it is a flat almost flat bassinet for an infant supercool and then you just snap it back to go back to the toddler seat making it really cool if you have for example I had a toddler who still napped and then I got an infant twins and I needed to kind of swap the two kids out in the middle of being out for the day so I would wear one when my toddler needed to nap and then when he was ok to walk or ride the ride on board that my infant went back in the stroller so this is really cool if you have that print situation going on it is perfect so that is the recline super easy to go up there s another so kind of three levels and to switch it back it s got two buttons on each side and they re not the easiest buttons you really have to push them but that s how you switch it back and forth so quick and the belly bar also just two little buttons boom and here is the canopy which is not ginormous but it s a decent canopy back here is the mesh peekaboo you can see the break is over here on the side and you step unlock flip flop friendly I love it here s the basket which again depending on the configurations your lower seat might get in the way the footrest are here you have to push the buttons there s two buttons and you have to push them in to get to footrest down and up so it goes like beyond vertical one two three is kind of horizontal and then for more than horizontal now I m going to show you how quickly and how easily this thing converts from double to single which makes it a super awesome option if you have two or three kids and sometimes you need a double and sometimes you need a single perhaps you just need to get one kid to the doctor like I do let me show you first step is take off weight take off that second seat super light there s a button I think they just flopped down like this not sure I m gonna take this beat up so I can see what I m doing here okay so you can see these are for the seat and there s like little button in here you push and it slides them now and now it s in the single position boom single mode done so now we re back to double get the seat out pop this up one two pop this one in and then lift these up one kill and here in double mode that seriously takes less than 30 seconds to go double the single and back to double like so amazing and no parts to lose here s the handlebar there s two buttons and it can go up you re super high super tall it can go down and we re gonna do the collapse it works better with only the backseat in but I ll show you it just regular collector just pull on these two and it goes down there we go so that is collapsed with both of them and it s self standing but this one makes it kind of stick out a lot so if you take this out and then you can fold these in and that s much better and then I guess we just kind of can do something like there you go sure here is the car seat that it comes with that the single stroller comes with for 400 it is good from four pounds and it also comes with the base for the car again this is the Evenflo pivot expand single to double stroller it is 400 for the single stroller with one seat and the car seat and it is 120 for the second seat making it 520 total it is an awesome stroller it is so quick to convert that is the best part about this stroller from all the others I ve seen the conversion wise it s the easiest it s a great push it doesn t get stuck on the cracks and stuff like umbrella strollers comment below do you

Joolz Hub Stroller,"Uppababy Cruz V2 vs Joolz Hub Mechanics, Comfort, Use","In order to keep our recommendations up to date, we maintain a Buyer s Guide with a wide spectrum of models, and a lot of ...",VtKIvUrVL74,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtKIvUrVL74,15606,168,2022-01-02T20:52:45Z,today we re going to do a basic comparison between the jules hub plus and the upper baby cruise v2 which we ve received several requests to compare due to their relatively similar features and dimensions we re big fans of both of these models and though there are important differences in particular with regards to which lifestyle factors you should consider when choosing between them both are constructed in a very robust manner and for this reason i won t be going into chassis structure and longevity today they re both simply built to last and if you d like to know about these aspects you should check out our standalone reviews for each model so let s get started then with the hub plus where i d first like to point out that despite using some footage of the nearly identical original hub in this video all of the information relates to the current hub plus model the hub plus clocks in at 11 kilos and folds down to 31 by 53 by 63 centimeters with the seat attached which is sufficiently compact the result of the seat s ability to fold as well to be carried by the model shoulder strap when needed though it is still a bit too heavy to do this for long distances as far as child comfort is concerned the hub plus seat has a near full life flat position and is newborn compatible by using either a bassinet or a padded cocoon but is unfortunately a bit on the small side and as such will really only be ideal for use for children younger than two and a half or three when it comes to real world use and which lifestyles the hub plus will be best suited for the model is primarily for urban conditions where its smaller size excels at navigating crowded spaces and taking up less storage room while still providing the full-size comforts of a reversible seat and the sturdiness and terrain capability needed to hold up to regular all-day use while tackling occasional gravel broken sidewalks and city parks the model s large rear wheels and decent suspension help a lot here while its front wheels at 6.3 inches will be the chief limiting factor determining where you can drive and while the hub plus is perfectly capable of handling the conditions i described it will still struggle to deal with nature trails or really rough cobblestones storage wise the hub plus shopping basket is pretty limited capable of fitting a bit of necessary baby gear but not designed to handle a full picnic load or a ton of shopping a situation that should not be hacked by hanging heavy bags from the handle lastly while the hub plus can work as a keep in the trunk model in my experience for most heavily car based lifestyles such as in suburban america you can usually get away with something a bit lighter and smaller and where this model fits perfectly instead where you ll get the most out of its capabilities is in big cities with a lot of stairs and public transport and the like in particular in colder parts of the world where you ll need to deal with a bit of snow moving on the cruise v2 weighs in at 11.5 kilos and folds down to 42 by 58 by 84 centimeters with the seat attached which is only a tad heavier than the hub plus but significantly larger being more of a midsize model in this respect and which is a fine size for fitting in the trunk but not for carrying around when it comes to child comfort the cruise v2 has a bucket seat with an adjustable leg rest that is larger than the seat on the hub plus extending ideal use by up to a year or so as a bucket seat the cruise v2 doesn t offer a full life flat position but like the hub plus the model is also pairable with an infant insert or a bassinet for use with newborns when it comes to parent comfort and ideal lifestyle the cruise v2 7-inch front wheels and incredible suspension struts one of the best suspension setups on the market definitely give it an edge over the hub plus for terrain capability though it will still be best to think of the model as meant mainly for around town driving and if you re headed off-road it should be to relatively well-maintained trails and dirt roads the cruise v2 also has significantly more storage capacity than the hub plus in fact it has a bigger basket than the majority of mid-size models out there and combined with its increased seat size and terrain capability the cruise v2 is simply a much better all-round model than the hub plus ideal for people who will need their stroller for more than just short trips while still not being so large or heavy as to be difficult to fit in the trunk or carry up the stairs when needed and if you re trying to decide between these two models then i would say that the cruise v2 is the more versatile choice and the one i would recommend for most people unless you have special need of a small folding model such as you drive a very small car or have severely limited storage space you know that you need a stroller that is easier to carry on a regular basis while moving through the world or you have special reasons for needing the hubplus s more adjustable seat recline in any case we hope you found this video useful and if you did we ask that you subscribe as it helps us to continue making videos in the future if you d like to know more about either of these models we have standalone reviews for both of them and links have been added in the description in addition if you are currently shopping for a stroller we have a buyer s guide on our patreon page which lists a wide range of models that we recommend with a lot of technical and lifestyle related information you can find that by following the link in the description as well thank you
Joolz Hub Stroller,Joolz Hub vs Nuna Mixx Next Stroller - baby stroller review,"Introducing Joolz and Nuna s new strollers. Let s compare. -Renae Before Clicking, Do This Joolz ...",1cOoH6S3xsE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cOoH6S3xsE,23222,235,2020-11-26T18:00:00Z,hello and welcome to pristas today we re going to put the jules hub plus next to the nuna mix next strollers and compare i m renee cody the founder of pristis and both of these strollers are available at pristas.com and if you can give this video a quick like that would help me out more than you know now on with the show all right on the left we have the nuna mix next stroller and on the right we have the jules hub plus stroller both of them gorgeous super high end strollers both of these would be considered the rolls-royce of strollers for sure you can see that the nuna is a little bit taller than the jewels hub plus to date i haven t seen a stroller that is as tall as the nuna this is what both strollers look like when the sun shade is collapsed the nuna sun shade canopy is made of like a canvassy type of texture material very high quality but it s definitely not completely wrinkle free and there are two easy buttons on the side to expand the nuna handlebar in the back the jewels hub plus stroller is expanded with two silver little knobs on the side there that you just push down as you expand both the jules hub plus and the nuna mix next just expand and collapse flawlessly here are both of the strollers back to back you can see that the nuna goes a little bit higher than the jewels hub plus and the handlebar is a little bit thicker on the top despite the jewels being like a silver stainless steel looking color and nuna being a black color they both feel very heavy duty like they re made from the same metals type material the nuna handlebar is in a leatherette that has a beautiful shine finish and the jewels is also a beautiful leatherette but in a matte finish the nuna has a handle in the back that you just flip up to bring the seat down to a reclining position for a nap time and the jewels has something in the back that you squeeze up to bring the seat into a reclining position for nap time as well Music now you can t completely see from this angle but both of the reclining positions are almost all the way down equal where my where i have my hand right now is where the bottom of the seat is on the noona is just the canopy is hiding it slightly the padding on both of these is also just absolutely gorgeous the jewels has a patent pending on their padding but both of these are very comfortable and both of the seats themselves the materials that they use are as smooth as butter the nuna s child straps comes out from the back and it s very comfortable and they have two nuna branded child rest strap paddings but on the bottoms of these strap paddings they don t have a padding and then they have the padding for the bottom buckle itself so the noona is actually different than the jewels in that the jewels here you can see there is padding all the way to the back of the child seat but also jules has a lower belt padding as well and they also have the lower belt buckle padded also nuna doesn t have the lower parts of the their belts padded but i don t think that that makes a huge difference my child has sat in the nuna and absolutely loves it and is comfortable so it s not a huge difference to buckle in a the nuna mix stroller it s actually like a two-piece system where you have to first connect the top strap and the bottom strap together first and then connect it into the middle slot kind of like a key and then they um buckle flawlessly as well joules is different because they have a four pronged buckle system which is super easy because you don t have to buckle in the top strap and the side strap together first before buckling it in it s really really easy and also unbuckles really easily to collapse nuna there are actual little things on the side they re kind of hard to figure out at first but just grab where i m grabbing and pull up on these extra little pieces and then and once you do so you can fold the handlebar over to collapse the stroller and it s really super easy noon is collapsing system is just one of their best features to collapse the jules hub plus it s a little bit more complicated than that and i specifically had a harder time doing it facing forward you first have to push a button underneath and then pull it up so you have to do both and then collapse it downward and then you have to collapse the top of the seat also by grabbing underneath the seat and pinching and then collapsing that and then it takes a little bit of strength but as you pull up the handlebar then you push down the bottom and you can use the beautiful strap also as well now i made the mistake of not collapsing the handlebar at first so make sure that s collapsed also to finish up the job Music the noona is great because it kind of has two collapsing positions you can always collapse it downward and the baby can actually still be even sitting in the stroller when you do it but to collapse it like the jewels hub plus you just collapse the back of the seat and you are done and the handlebar being extended actually doesn t affect the folding like it does with the jules hub plus the expanding from a folding position is fairly straightforward for both strollers once you do it once or twice you just get the hang of your own stroller and expand it you can see me here expanding the nuna you just expand the handlebar and then pull back the seat and then pull your sun shade forward Music for the jules hub plus to expand it first expand the seat bottom and then the handlebar and then bring the set the main handlebar up and then you have to kind of put the wheels in position Music and then you can also bring down the baby s feet nuno you can see put a lot of thought into their wheels they are bigger and just go over bumps a little smoother but jules has a front wheel locking system where you can actually click down the front wheel to make it so that the front wheel can t turn from side to side jules wheel is on the left of your screen and nunes is on the right and nuna s is a little bit bigger and fuller and goes over bumps a little smoother jewels on the left and nuna on the right both have locking mechanisms for their strollers this one is nuna s you just click your foot on the red to lock it and green to unlock it jewels you just click downward to lock it and then you can either put your foot on the top to unlock it or you can put your foot underneath the lock and click upwards to unlock it both of the baskets underneath are made very well nunes doesn t seem to have the anti-wrinkle but i m sure if you put it into a bathroom with a hot shower it the wrinkles would come right out jules is a little bit more movable probably with the expanding and jules also has you can light you can add a battery to that and have it have it light up as well on the back of the seats you can see that nuna actually has a pocket which would be perfect for like a wallet or a phone jules doesn t have those but you can see it s made from such a deluxe material and just is a smooth butter i just keep saying butter with anything to do with jewels or nuna and nuna s recline for the seat is with a handle jewels is with a pinch Music both the nuna and the jewels seats can turn around to be forward parent facing or world facing and both of them actually have really easy handles on the side to turn it around nuna you just pinch the handles and turn it jules is a little bit different and that you need to bring the seat up first Music as you bring it up you have to pinch the bottom of the bottom seat to lift up and then you can turn it around now both the nuna and the jewels have one of my favorite features that i surprisingly needed with my own baby and that was that it has an expandable sun shade or for shade and jewels expands downward and has this gorgeous uh netting here so that you can see your baby through the top nuna has a peekaboo on the top that is functional open or closed with magnets beautiful and then nuna also has an expandable shade as well that you can just pull down on and you can see peekaboo shade also works there as well and then there s an additional peekaboo in the back here where you can see your baby there as well Music with jewels their sun shade is so fabulous because you can push the peekaboo closed or open and it just looks so amazing either way and noona i love that it opens and closes with magnets the top peekaboo whether or not the expanded part of the sunshade is open and then you can also open the back and here you can see it open totally from the back and there s also a spot on the side with the mesh so you can see your baby there as well no one can complain about the way a jewels hub plus or the way a nuna mix next stroller handles you can see how it handles here and just moves around with such ease there s just no complaints whatsoever there s a reason these are the rolls-royce of strollers both of these Music one thing about the nuna is that when the handlebar is extended it s definitely more for a taller person now i m fairly short i m 5 3 but if you are a tall person and you need a stroller for a taller person then the nuna mix next is definitely for you the jules hub plus is not small though it s not necessarily for a quote-unquote shorter person the jules hub plus is actually about the standard size of strollers that i see with like the duna and the other jewel strollers it s just more uh standard size i would say both of the strollers are just great and they re really well thought out ultimately you re just what do you want to walk this down the street with because both of them are comfortable for your baby both of them are easy for you as a mom to use both of them are compatible with a bunch of travel systems i personally use a nuna pipa lite lx car seat and that car seat would actually work with both of these strollers you just have to get a compatible adapter for both of them these strollers are just both absolutely gorgeous i m sure you d agree picking one of these is kind of like picking nikon or canon cameras are you a nikon person or a canon person same thing with these strollers are you a nuna person or a jewels person both brands are completely eco-friendly both brands have amazing manufacturer warranties and are completely safe for your baby and both are definite status symbols not that you care about that but they are definite status symbols if you walk down the street with either one of these people are like what stroller is that they re absolutely gorgeous and both of these are available at my shop at pristas.com don t forget to give this video a like it helps me out more than you know and i will see you in a couple days with more goodies

and today we re gonna take a look at the brand new Britt Tech s bfree stroller this is a great lightweight compact stroller that s great for travel grandparents house or for just an everyday stroller so let s take a look so let s start with the seat the seat has a weight capacity of up to 65 pounds it s a very large child so you can use it from birth all the way to 65 college the seat measures 13 inches wide with a 20 inch seat back and a measurement from the back of the seat to the top of the canopy up here of 26 inches this seat sports an adjustable padded five-point harness the buckle you just push this button and it pops open in the seat there are two mesh pockets for a sippy cup a bottle or some kind of snack the seat is lightly padded and right here is a cat breast if you lift this up this exposes a nice big entrance to the basket so in case you don t want to go in from the back you can access the basket from the front or the back and here s one of the pockets on the be free because the be free is stopped with storage actually it has seven different pockets this is one there are two in the seat and we ll show you the other four in just a minute now with the recline on the see this recline it s an easy to do deep recline it s a strap system it goes all the way up there and then when you pull in this with one hand it s an infinite recline so it will stop anywhere you stop and that goes all the way back to there which is very deep which is great for a nap time on the back of the seat there is a panel here you can lift up it exposes a large mesh panel which allows air to circulate through the seat on a hot day which I love if it s a little chilly or you just go ahead and put it down then here are three more pockets one here another one and a large zipper pocket right there so like I said plenty of storage to put the seat up to loop your fingers in here and go all the way up and this is as upright as the seat gets now let s go added the wheels and basket the B three features base three wheel design the rear wheels there no flat they re 10 inches and the front wheel it s a 360-degree swivel wheel and it measures about seven inches now this wheel it does rotates great maneuverability but if you wanted to go through a little bit of mommy terrain such as grass playground mulch and gravel you re going to want to go ahead and lock this straight and just lift that button that s gonna lock it into place so it doesn t get caught up in every bump now the be free is not a jogging stroller so you re not gonna want a jog with this it s not for sport use but like I said for a little mommy terrain you can lock it if you would like to what if you re doing everyday use I would just keep it in swivel mode not in the back here there s a one step break just step down and it locks the stroller into place and then you lift up lately and it lets it go free now here is the basket the basket is very roomy I have got my trusty Jujubee be classy unit Kiki 2.0 I love this one it just goes right there in the basket easy fit a lot of things I could still fit a jacket a sweater or blanket and I love the fact the basket dips down like this in the back now why would you need that let s say your child is sleeping in the seat you don t have a lot of access room but since it goes down I can easily still get my diaper bag without waking my child I love that there s also another pocket in the basket right here does zipper mesh pockets so that if you want things not to roll around the basket you can put them there so it has a really nice basket and like I said you can access the basket from the front as well so let s talk about the canopy it s a large two panel canopy but because the size matters when it comes to canopy you can impress your friends at the politico when you undo this zipper and expose a third panel this is a full coverage canopy plus it has a large peekaboo window I love that the peekaboo window is mesh so it adds added air flow through the seat especially on a hot day you can roll this thing up and also tuck it under if you want to keep it open or if it s windy or cold you can go ahead and lay it flat there is no velcro on the closure I love that the no velcro just magnetic closure which is fantastic now the handlebar it s an double handlebar up and down so for average height people like myself at five five easily I put it right there and I can push it but I could also put it all the way up to here forty-four inches from ground where I placed my hands for those taller moms and dads so I love the fact that it s adjustable but I also love the fact that it s not a foam handlebar this is a rubberized handlebar so if the handle were actually lines scrape against the concrete it s not gonna take chunks out of the foam like you see on other shoulders so I absolutely love the handlebar now let me show you how easy it is to fold it s a one-handed fold very compact just go ahead and put back your canopy there is a safety button right here it s great you push that in and then there s a strap in the seat you grab it and the whole thing folds down like that this hand did nothing that s right it s a one-handed fold it weighs in at just about twenty-one pounds so it s easy to maneuver and easy to store transport things like that I could pop off these real wheels if I wanted to make it even more compact very easily it hasn t auto lock right here on the side like I said very compact package and then when you when unfold it just undo your life pretty much let it open like that until you hear it click into place and you re ready to go how fantastic is that now the baby also becomes a travel system with Britt s hex infant car seats involved infant car seats it comes with the adapter so you don t have to buy anything separate which i think is fantastic you just have to forgot which side goes on which you slide these in there s a little snap here you re gonna snap when you are using it with an infant car seat like that and your car seat you would go ahead and put your seat down and the car seat just snaps right in so easy plus if you re using and most of the time as an infant car seat travel system you can go ahead and leave the adapters attached when you fold it and put it into your trunk and then you just go ahead and remove them that easy when it s time to just use the seat so that s it guys the paint free retails for three hundred and fifty nine dollars it s a quality stroller so I definitely it s worth it what are your favorite features of the new protects brief read leave me a

Britax B-Free Stroller,New! 2018 Britax B Free Stroller Review,Britax s new B-Free Stroller is an upgrade from their popular B-Agile 3. We have been testing ours for a few weeks. Check out our ...,guhDV0Rzbng,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guhDV0Rzbng,44027,137,2018-02-01T04:51:28Z,hi everyone I m Lisa EO from growing your baby and today we are checking out bright X s be free travel system so you can see here this is the stroller and we introduces to you really quickly at ABC in October this was released at the end of last year and what I really really love about this is that it s an upgrade from one of my very favourite strollers so if you ve watched our channel before you ve probably seen the review on the 2016 and the 2015 the agile stroller and this is the big sister to the be agile bright ex has added a ton of really great features and there s some really cool stuff included here that I really love that parents are on the go will really really like so right from the beginning here this is your compact package what you notice on this stroller is that this is sticking out a little bit this is one of the features I really like so this is a really nice compact fold I m holding it by the strap on the seat this is how I transport the stroller it does have a frame lock so it s not going to come open if you are running through the airport and it folds really easily it only weighs 22 pounds and its really really nice to use so I m just gonna turn it this way to get it open so to get it open you just open the frame lock pull this and up it goes you can see here the handle bar is actually in the really really upright position I put it in that position when we re done with it because it actually allows it to scan the nicest you can see it doesn t just which is really nice so from birth parents can use a stroller two ways they can use it with the bright X be safe car seat which I have here I m going to show that to in just a second or you can use you can put the baby directly in the stroller in the lay flat position which I ll do in just a second so I ll show you the car seat first because this is one of my favorite things about this is that this is a really nice travel stroller it is lightweight but it does turn into a really good travel system which takes up very little room in your car but is really very full-featured so we have here the Endeavour s car seat so this is bright X s latest car seat really really nice seat they ve made a lot of really cool changes you can see on the back here of the base we ve got the anti rebound bar so the stroller comes with the adapters and they just snap right in so once you get those in you just pop this off just recline this seat a tiny little bit and then this pops in so the car seat itself has a canopy and then the strollers canopy just goes over top to create a bit of a nook for the baby if you want to the seat actually does fit in both ways I m not a big fan of this I actually think brands did this just because so many parents were doing this anyway and it was wrong and it was wrecking the connectors so I think they made them reversible for that way but if you have a newborn baby it s not a good idea to face them out because it is too much stimulation you also can t see them so there isn t a peekaboo window on the canopy for the car seat so you can t see what they re up to so for that reason I love having them facing you another thing I like is that getting an in and out is the same way as getting it in and off the base so it s just this at the back and sometimes we ll see with some manufacturers they make getting it out of the stroller a different method than removing it from the base so I like that continuity so this seat is from four pounds to 35 pounds 32 inches it has the two levels of side impact protections we have the shell here on the side and then we ve got the side and protect impact protection around their heads it has the rethread harness which is probably one of my favorite features on a car seat because something that parents really hate doing is retreading every single child time their child gets bigger and then you can see here we ve got the premium fabrics on this which are really soft this actually can be connected to the your car three different ways and this is one of the new features for this seat this year you can do it through the belt bypass here you can use the base or bright X s out of the UK the European belt path so this is nice for families who live in urban cities and can t bring the base this is a really nice way to make sure that the car seat is in the cure and the taxi or whichever vehicle you re riding in snugly so watch our channel because we re into a full review on just the seats so when you re not using the stroller with the infant car seat you can take these oats and then as I mentioned the seat does a full recline for newborns and that s just at the back here so you can see we just have a button here that pulls down that s your full recline for a newborn and then what s nice about this line of strollers is that you can basically put it at whatever height you want so you ll see here the seat itself has an adjustable five-point harness this seat is really nice and quilted this is an upgrade from the be agile we ve got the padded harness strips it can be adjusted to three different heights with the crutch strap here and then on the seat something that they have added for this model are two different side pockets so if you want to put a bottle on the side you want to touch some toys you want to make sure your kids have everything they need while you re out you can stuff those in these little pockets here something else which I really like is this foot well here so on the previous model there wasn t an indent in footwell and I really like this because it gives older kids a place to rest their feet what s kind of cool about this is that when you lift this up there s actually a pocket hidden underneath so if you ve got something that you want to kind of keep hidden a little bit you can kind it you can put that under here this stroller actually boasts seven different storage pockets which I really really like because you and I both know as parents we take a lot of stuff with us and we need a lot of that storage to kind of keep it where it needs to be this is also kind of nice as well because if you are really packing up this storage basket and you want to grab something from the front it s really accessible this way so the canopy on this stroller is massive it has an SPF on it to keep your child protected during hot days this canopy is also very robust so it doesn t blow back on windy days which I love they ve added the mesh window at the back for more ventilation it does have the magnets so we have to worry about that velcro sound if you re trying to peek in on a sleeping baby and then also at the back here we ve got that storage I was talking about just gonna pull this down a tiny bit so you ve got two more pockets here we ve got a zip pocket here there s stuff that s more sensitive and then when you lift this up there s actually a full mesh panel back here that will give your baby that ventilation they ll need on hot days so one thing I love is this storage one thing you don t get on travel strollers is good storage it s you normally hit-or-miss this one has really really good storage but I like this so I like that when you need to stuff with your bags or your kids gear in here you ve got this spring loaded back this is a reinforced bottom so you re gonna find that it s not going to drag if you do kind of over stuff it again another hidden pocket here so this is just kind of on the underside of the basket and it s hidden as well so there are some really nice hidden pockets so that if you do have something that s a little bit you know you want to keep your cell phone here you can do that and people won t really be able to see that also at the back here we do have the stroller wheel lock this is just the single side so the single side locks both wheels you can see here very very easy to engage and disengage these are ten inch rubber wheels and they re incredible so a little bit bigger than what we saw on the be agile and what this is really great for is if you re going over uneven terrain gravel sand tall grasses this is really really nice for that the three wheel configuration is really great for maneuvering through busy places and really kind of getting through the mall or if you re at an amusement park and it s very very packed the front wheel does have that locked option for bumpier terrain I actually don t love that feature on any stroller because I find that you lose the maneuverability but if you are a lunker if you re on cobblestone or if you re on a really kind of uneven or very bumpy road and you want to make sure that you ve got more control over your stroller you do have that option so as I mentioned at the beginning this stroller has an adjustable handlebar there are six positions that you can adjust it to so this is the lowest and then we ve got everything really in-between up to this position so this is great for parents of different heights because of the way that bright X designs this frame back here there really isn t a kicking the frame issue but parents who are of different heights this is nice for them so that they can adjust this to the height that suits them the best so the star feature of this stroller I think is how easy it folds and you can do this by just pressing this grey button on the side and pulling up on this now having that bar in that position ensures that when it s locked it ll actually stand on its own this is the feature I m very fond of because I truly believe that as busy parents you want your stroller to stay in the spot that you left it if your kids decide to run off so I love it when brands really go that extra mile to design the stroller to make sure that it does stand so there you go guys this is bright X s be free stroller and then of course if you combine it with their be safe car seats or with any of the Bob car seats it does turn into a travel system which I love it weighs 22 pounds which makes it perfect for travel and it s designed for kids from birth to 65 pounds now I know a lot a lot of you are thinking that you re not going to use a stroller up to 65 pounds but for parents who have children with special needs this is a godsend I love how easy the stroller is to use I love its compact package I love all the features that Bry Texas packed into it this is really one of my favorite picks for new parents thank you so much for joining me and please subscribe to our channel for

Britax B-Free Stroller,Britax B-Free Stroller - Long Term Review 2 years later,Long term review of the Britax B-Free stroller after two years of use in Chicago and Southern California.

the britax be free my husband and i did so much research about two years ago when we were searching for a stroller and now that our daughter is 18 months old i want to talk about the good and the bad let s get started Music so in the past two years we ve lived in chicago and now here in southern california and i really have not seen a lot of moms pushing the stroller around and i m trying to figure out why because if you want a good napping stroller one with tons of storage and want to buy just one stroller this one s for you we started using the be free from day one with eliza through the travel system now if this is your first time buying a stroller like it was for us and have no idea what a travel system is it basically is an infant car seat that clicks into a stroller this is perfect so you can transport baby from car to stroller without waking him or her up we paired the be free with the britax endeavor car seat which is one of the highest rated car seats on the market we bought this as a travel system so it came with the adapters britax also sells other adapters that are compatible with other brand name car seats now the be free is unique because it has this canopy shade with a zippered extension that covers almost the full length of the seat not only is that amazing sun protection it acts as blackout shape from babies trying to nap on the go when eliza was an infant the sun shade from the car seat plus the canopy on the stroller created this little black room that plus a sound machine and she took great naps on the go and that was super helpful whenever i needed to run errands or meet with friends without the noise or light from surroundings bothering her and it never got too hot in there for her with the canopy drawn because there s this little mesh peekaboo window at the top so you can keep eyes on baby it s a magnetic closure so the sound of velcro won t wake baby up and now that she s older the befree has an infinite recline seat that lays almost entirely flat to keep baby girl comfortable my second favorite part about the be free is the amount of storage it has seven different compartments behind the seat is zippered storage that s perfect for wipes hand sanitizer and snacks and there are pockets to hold your keys and your phone there are also hidden zippered pockets in the basket underneath to hold more personal items and that basket underneath is huge it even fits my extra large diaper bag and when i would walk to the store in chicago it would fit a ton of groceries and the best part is that it s accessible from the front so you don t have to take everything out to reach the items you stored first and my husband s favorite feature the adjustable handlebar i know what a dork but to be fair he s 6 4 and i m 5 8 so that was really important to us the handlebar goes much lower so it can easily accommodate any height the stroller also comes with a one-handed fold which is really convenient because let s face it we ve all got our hands full you just push this button and pull the center handle and the stroller folds right up and with that adjustable handlebar it stands upright if you release this lever the stroller opens back up easily and the seat comes attached so you don t have to remove that separately as for the specs the b3 accommodates babies from birth in the travel system to about 65 pounds we were able to put eliza in the stroller without using a car seat right around four months the stroller weighs about 22 pounds so i want to say that s in the middle when it comes to stroller weight it s not as light as some of the travel strollers out there but also not as heavy as some of the more popular models plus it s about several hundred dollars cheaper it has a three wheel configuration for easy maneuvering and all-terrain rubber tires these held up very very well during chicago winters with all the snow and ice we get plus i have no problem pushing this through grassy fields in your playgrounds now to the cons back when we used to travel pre-covered i d give this stroller about an 8 out of 10 when trying to get through an airport i love it for the napping aspect but you do have to take the wheels off to fit it onto the security belt and when we would check the stroller at the gate we d also have to take the wheels off to fit it into our stroller bag which honestly wasn t that big of a deal because the wheels are pretty easy to take off the stroller also doesn t come with a cup holder but what i did was attach this stroller caddy that fits my extra large water bottle and comes with this handy zippered mommy pouch you need something pretty flexible so that it doesn t lose its shape when you pull the stroller up i ll put a link to that in the description box below if you re interested alright guys i hope you found this review helpful two years later i can honestly say that i would buy the same exact stroller again i did see that britax recently came out with the be free premium i haven t personally seen it but just by reading some of the specs it comes with the stain resistant fabric that handlebar is made out of leather and the canopy comes ventilated but in my opinion you lose some of that blackout feature that i love so much if you re interested in learning more i ll put a link to that stroller in the description box below so as you can see i m new here let me know in the comments if there are other videos you d like to see and if you did like this video i d appreciate it so much if you hit that subscribe button until the next one bye you

Cybex e-Priam Stroller,Cybex E-Priam Mini Review,"In order to keep our recommendations up to date, we maintain a Buyer s Guide with a wide spectrum of models, and a lot of ...",nRSNs-szBok,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRSNs-szBok,53940,206,2020-11-18T13:59:41Z,today we re going to be taking a brief look at the cybex e3 m this is the third installment of what we re thinking of as mini reviews meant to give you a basic impression of models that we don t currently have time to cover with a full review for our channel the epriam is in a way not worth a full review anyway since other than the motor functions it is identical to the regular preamp and despite some misleading information out there there have really been no relevant mechanical changes made to the model since our review in 2019. what has changed since then however is the wider market and the pre-m s place in that market so before we discuss those nifty motor functions let s revisit the basic model for a moment to get a picture of the pre-amp as a whole the pre-amp is an urban oriented mid-sized four-wheel swivel wheel reversible seat model whose main selling points other than the snazzy piping are mainly its highly adjustable seat it s one handed one piece fold and it s relatively lightweight mechanically speaking the model is generally unremarkable in its price class with its strongest attribute being a pretty simple and solid central folding mechanism which was more exciting at the time of its launch as were at slightly larger than average front wheels when the mid-sized market was mainly dominated by style-oriented but structurally weak models since that time however the market has changed phasing out a lot of those less practical showy models in favor of a variety of models built both stronger than the pre-amp and with either the same sized or larger front wheels yet despite this the pre-m does stand out now as it always has in one distinct way it s criminally expensive with the basic model this is just impossible to justify in my opinion and always was really but with the eprem which costs even more it s harder to know right because it s electronic and motorized and those things cost money so let s jump into it then and have a look at those motor functions to see whether the epriam has earned its price tag for those of you who don t fully understand how the model works the motorized functions of the e-prem essentially claim to offer the following that the model takes less force to push over rough terrain or uphills and also takes less force to hold while descending hills due to its braking function now despite wide cries that this is all just a gimmick i do actually feel that these functions could prove quite useful to a very specific portion of the public this is a special needs model only it hasn t been advertised that way so before i explain where and for whom the stroller could be useful let s address the rest of you as far as powering over rough terrain is concerned i would remind you that the e-pream is only the regular preamp with a motor and the regular pre-amp is a city model if you drive it too often over rough terrain you will break it the world is not made of foam rubber and i m hoping that if any of you see anything even remotely like those hilly mats that they have next to the e prem display in every stroller store where it s sold you ll be smart enough to avoid those patches regularly using the motor to force your way over rough terrain like that is a death sentence especially for the model s front wheels and housings and cybex s guarantee is pretty bad too by the way designed to cover the minimum they can get away with as far as i read it understanding then that the motor does not turn the basic pre-amp into a dirt bike let s address going uphill here the motor will make pushing the model easier but please note that we re already talking about smooth pavement and a stroller that s pretty lightweight and maneuverable so how useful is this function then really to touch the subject delicately does the choice not to push a lightweight wheeled object up a smooth paved hill really fit with the fresh and fashionable lifestyle images that cybex uses to sell the model or would it actually be more accurate to view this as the stroller equivalent of the fast food drive-thru and then there s that last element the self-braking on downward slopes and here i have to admit there is some use value hills can be sketchy especially if there s some ice or snow on the ground but it better not be a lot of ice not late winter many times thawed and re-frozen ice and it better not be more than a drifting of snow because it s still just a midsize model with relatively low tolerance for such conditions in the end then even though this function is a tad useful if you live in these sort of conditions anyway then the e3 am won t give you a quarter of the capability you could get out of a decent three-wheeler with a dynamic handbrake and with these motor functions being only peripherally useful my honest hunch is that if you were to buy the e3m you wouldn t be using them much anyway the way i understand it the battery dies if you forget to turn it off after use just like your car battery if you don t fully close the door and it takes six hours to charge it up given those facts how many people with eprems are out there right now who don t use the motor functions 90 of the time on the other hand as i indicated earlier there is probably one group of people who never fail to charge the battery for whom the epm is actually really useful and that is people who have medical conditions such as arthritis or back problems perhaps have just undergone difficult c-sections or our elderly grandparents from a practical standpoint this stroller is not just something to stand next to in your instagram pictures it s for them even though i haven t seen it portrayed this way in any of cybex is advertising in any case we hope you found this video interesting if you d like to know more about this model or the basic preamp we recommend you watch our review of this basic model as well we d also like to ask you to subscribe as it helps us to continue making videos in the future in addition if you are currently shopping for a stroller we have a buyer s guide on our patreon page which lists a wide range of models that we recommend with a lot of technical and lifestyle related information you can find it by following the link in the description thank you

Cybex e-Priam Stroller,Yep...I GOT A 2499 PRAM was it worth it?!? Cybex ePriam,For daily stories come over to INSTAGRAM margarita.nazarenko To shop the ePriam ...,TYv2CLSuYDQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYv2CLSuYDQ,22720,341,2021-06-08T03:21:40Z,hi guys welcome back to my channel my name is margarita for those who don t know me and for those who do welcome back my loves hi guys welcome back to my channel on today s video i m going to be discussing my baby s stroller and namely a magical almost amazing innovative new design stroller it is very much a unicorn in the baby stroller game so you might want to watch this one if you re having a baby or if you re interested in gadgets because this is the e-stroller it s basically like the tesla of strollers i am of course referring to the cybex and disclaimer first of all i have the original pream cybex it s like a pram but it s called a pream that s their play on words that s what they want to do let them live and this one is the e-version so disclaimer first i have the pre-am the original one and i have the car seat and i have the lux bassinet and i was speaking to anstel brands about my love for cybex they re a company here in australia in melbourne i believe and you can shop them online i ll put the link below and they told me that they have the new epram and i was like okay okay i see you what s that for because my husband loves gadgets and they told me that it s basically that electronic version it s from zero to 22 kilos just like the original pram and i was like oh that s so cool and they were like do you want us to send it to you and i said sure because who wouldn t want that so in this video you ll see my first reaction upon using it because this pram assists you as you push it takes the weight of the baby so you don t have to put your back out and it also this is my favorite feature by far i m just gonna ruin it now but this is my favorite feature by far if you re going down a hill it assists you with not rolling down so literally if you even push the pram and let go which you shouldn t do don t do that do not do that the baby s waking up it will help you as well so my thoughts on this pram are coming up in the video but overall it s a very very interesting product indeed the price point is the thing that of course people want to know about on the ancel brands website the original cybex which is i guess the best comparison because we re judging the electronic part of it not necessarily the cybex against other prams so comparatively with the original one which i already have it s 1 800 for the original versus 2499 for the electric version so that s a steep price difference and in this video i m going to be discussing whether it s worth it or not the baby workout feeling a little bit emotional he wants to tell you about the cybex pram too what did you think of it leo i guess there s several ways that you can judge a pram and that is on baby comfort on weight yeah you go on baby s comfort on weight on usability and things like that what hi who s that i m not sure it s gonna be possible to film with the squish is it so i m gonna have to come back to you guys hi it s me i m back this is like a week later and little tiny leopard is sleeping but today s a really big day he starts daycare today i have all these cathartic crazy emotions um i tried a vitamin c yesterday i ve got a concealer on and it s not blocking it but that s what happened nobody punched me in the face don t worry actually leo does punch me a bit in the face but excuse the play area being all crazy because to be honest if we don t get this video in we re never gonna get it in so we need to do this and we need to film so he s sleeping and i m so excited that he s going to daycare only two days a week it means i can edit it means i can film it means we can start talking again i am so excited but i want to fill you in about this cybex experience because a couple of people have already messaged me the cybex is basically your luxury answer to a to a pram it s stylish it s sexy it comes in the beautiful chromes it comes in those you know stunning rose golds that s what attracted me to it the magpie that i am i didn t go for the weight or the actions of the pram i just loved the look of it saying that though the pram itself is a very usable pram and the reason i m telling you this is because the pre-amp the e-prime the electric one is exactly the same functions it s a slightly tiny bit heavier but just like a fraction that you won t notice but it still folds the same it comes in the beautiful mattes and chromes and rose golds it attaches the carry cot the luxe carry cot even the names of this brand are just gorgeous and delicious and leo used the carry cot until he was about five months and then he used the the normal priam seat and the thing i will note about the seat is lea has another pram also at his grandparents house and the height of the seat is perfect if you have a tall child leo s head is now hitting where the hood is on another pram we have which is designed for up to four years old the guy is one year old and the pre-am is way above his head so i will tell you that that s very useful but again the video is not just about comparing cybex to other brands it s about comparing the new epram to the original and by the way if you re a fashionista you re gonna love all the materials that it comes in it s like a myriad of different beautiful fashion collections and collaborations that they ve done so that s another big plus now the difference and whether it s worth the money comparison if you already saw it on cybex you re like yep it s my brand i love it i m gonna get it should you get the e-pram or the original pram my thing is go big or go bigger if you re gonna go there you might as well go for the e-prime i love the experience if i haven t already put the footage in i ll put it in now leah what do you think baby what do you think of the color babe i got gray to be different from the black of the is he comfortable yeah i think so yeah put a little hood over sun protect wow Music oh that s it i think it s ready yeah slowed down going down there yeah did you hear that yeah you push it what does it feel like you push it it s going to kick in now go on you do it first oh my god babe is it stalling down the hill oh my gosh i think you re supposed to keep your hands on it yeah let me see leah oh he looks comfortable have you seen him no you haven t yeah do you like it my hat oh he s so happy is it comfy cozy who s happy if you were going to get a cybex would you get the crab or just a normal it was worth it i think so especially where we live whereas heavy whereas hilly so we re out in the city and i ve got the parking um not the parking assist sorry the the pram on there they go okay it stops down the slope about you good job you do it again hold on leo where you going boy my favorite feature is not necessarily the assist that helps you push the pram along which is actually brilliant but it s also the fact that when you re going downhill and you let go of the pram not that you d be doing that it s not recommended but it comes to a stop it s almost like the new generation cars all have break hold right now this prime is your answer to that it s sold as a luxury city pram but i think truly it would be great for anybody with more than one child because if you re dealing with either a dog or a toddler and you ve got a baby in there and you let go of the pram it will come to a stop it s a safety feature also i think it s great for people who love gadgets and it s great for people who love something new i think most brands will start coming out with their own answer to this i haven t updated you guys on this but i did wreck my foot during the pregnancy that s a whole other video but i will be needing a surgery and the cybex is definitely going to be my prime of choice when it comes to that because i m going to be in a moon boat and it s going to be great so i ve seen a couple of reviews that say the epram if somebody is for somebody that probably needs assistance like grandparents or somebody who s gone through a surgery or something like that but i think that slightly skewed that opinion only because for it to be a grandparent assisting pram it doesn t need to look so damn hot i think it s a new generation thing i think it s your iphone to your original home phone and i think it s wonderful one thing i will say though because i don t want to be biased because it was given to me by and still brands i want to be honest because my obligation is to you not them if you are somebody for whom aesthetics don t matter so much and you re just constantly on the go and you just need to get out of the house and you just need a very light easy going life the charging of the battery for me is something that i had to remember and would put me off not because the battery is hard to charge it s very easy you just plug the pram in but because i live in a house over three stories my garage door sometimes doesn t work because of this temperamental so i just sometimes cannot carry the pram upstairs and leo upstairs he s a 13 kilo chunk so if you have an organized life where you can just charge the thing but also keep in mind the chargeable battery part comes off so what i m saying is just i m a lazy bum but you can take off the battery and you can bring it upstairs and charge it mom life for me is already chaotic so sometimes i would forget to charge it however the benefit of it is you can always just use it as a normal pram so it s not something that s dependent on working like you know if you don t charge your iphone it doesn t work with the pram with the eprem it s still pre-am i need to say the thing correctly it still works um i just think it s so aesthetically beautiful it s a stunning thing to use i just love it and as you can see it advertised here it s table seat height it s it s a gorgeous gorgeous product it comes with accessories and everything like that and the weight is 12.6 kilos i think that s an average weight for a pram and if you re not lifting it up the stairs and there s no problem and think about the fact that if it s assisted it feels like you re not pushing anything so for me overall it s a really impressive product it s an innovative product i like innovation in all things always so for me it s a yes if you re in the market for the cybex in the first place if you like the luxury look if you like the rose gold if you like the chrome if you want that kind of experience motherhood in itself can be something i m putting the phone away nobody needs to know the stats i m sure you can google them yourself if you really want the brand but i m going to tell you as a human being if you want to have an experience in motherhood that is more elevated if you want to look a certain way it s hard when you first have a baby especially as a first-time mom you feel like a loss of identity and you feel i don t care who you are even if mothering was your main goal in life you feel a slight loss of identity and you feel some kind of like vulnerability to the fact that i remember putting leo in a pram not the cybex but just the prime i had and his grandparents house and i m in leggings and i m in sweatshirts like often amber it s a fancy one today and you re just walking and you re like wow i used to wear manolos and have a birkin i still have workings but like you know and it s also the the crisis of the current world health and what s happening i feel like if you just want to prioritize yourself and prioritize how you feel i think the cybex has the camera been kind of oh that s better in it or isn t it anyway it doesn t matter oh hello that s we re just friends having a chat so i think if you want to prioritize that for yourself the cybex is such a beautiful thing to have because i think there s something to be said in life that when life is beautiful i mean aesthetically and it s a beautiful experience it elevates the everyday routine and everyday things that you do for example i spent quite a bit on a water bottle it s black it s chrome it s gorgeous it s very sexy it s very easy to drink from the inside straw that you don t even see is gold i m now drinking two liters of water i think the same thing applies to skin care when people have debates about you know uh do you need all this fancy stuff like why does this brand cost so much i think sometimes in the human experience when you elevate something it s like fine dining or heels or anything you just you commit to it more you create a ritual you create an experience and that s the cybex for me i m not going to tell you that it s the best pram in the world because i don t know what the best is i m me i m marguerita on the internet like i can t tell you what you are or what your aesthetics are but i would say that i love it i love the seat belts it s like a luxury beautiful experience and like me and simon said it s like business class for a baby right it s the business class pram so it s just like about elevating that every day for you so go to the store check it out if you love it let me know and let me know if you think the price is worth it um leo definitely enjoys it but anyway guys i m so glad to be sending him off to university aka daycare and i ve got so many videos to come out unboxings of luxury things that i haven t even opened they re sitting in my wardrobe waiting for me to have a chance for leo to go to daycare so that i can do this and i m very very excited i feel like this year has been a blur i m so glad i dedicated it to raising leo not that i m stopping raising leo now i m gonna be with him every day but it s more like i really go harder go home go harder go harder i really dedicate myself to things and it s been a crazy year but it s been amazing and we ve really bonded little leopard and i and now it s time to get these videos up and get back to work all right guys love you let s say jellytots see you in the next one

Thule Spring Stroller,"Thule Spring, An Impartial Review Mechanics, Comfort, Use","In order to keep our recommendations up to date, we maintain a Buyer s Guide with a wide spectrum of models, and a lot of ...",OJunUiI8_Zk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJunUiI8_Zk,35243,245,2020-03-30T16:52:16Z,today we re going to be looking at the spring a small-sized daily model from Tula who has the tendency to take a pretty different approach from a lot of other manufacturers both in terms of materials in design but also just in terms of where they have so far in their marketing as well as how they deal with distribution in fact up until recently - the strollers were really only available with sporting goods stores here in Norway and their line is still heavily oriented towards jogging and off-road use the spring then is part of a shifting design direction for Tula and expansion into the wider non-sporting stroller market so let s have a look starting off with some stats the spring clocks I m at nine and a half kilos I can fold down to 32 by 45 by 76 centimeters it can take up to 5 kilos in a shopping basket and 22 kilos in the seat in addition to weight capacity Tula gives further specifications for the seat claiming that is suitable from six months to four years old and can take a childs Falls 111 centimeters but these latter claims are something that I would unfortunately disagree with based on the setup of the lower portion of the seat though I generally consider a lot of the bells and whistles on strollers these days unnecessary in comparison with just working out basic features in a sturdy and longevity focused manner the spring seat still feels a bit sparse for me size-wise the main body of the seat is ok and as a three-wheeler is even a few centimetres wider than a lot of other models from this class and the canopy is also quite decent for coverage being both extendable as well as incorporating an additional sun flap but the problem comes with a lower end of the seat which firstly doesn t have an adjustable leg rest a feature I ve come to expect on strollers of this size and secondly has a very narrow angled footrest which doesn t provide sufficient room in my opinion for the feet of an older toddler as a result of these factors I would unfortunately place the top age for the spring at or around 3 years of age and even then with a larger 3 year old it may be difficult to find a good foot position during that time one last thing to mention as far as the seat is concerned is that even though textile removal is not the nightmare that they had on the glide series it s still difficult on the spring involving the removal of screws and the textiles themselves are also hand wash only mainly due to non removable base and back boards when it comes to parent comfort and ease of use this is where I would say this ring excels it s lightweight it folds small with a very simple and accessible one whole system it has a handle which is adjustable for both short and tall parents alike and it s shopping basket is large and easily accessible which is rare on three-wheeled models out of the box the spring drives wonderfully as well which to be honest is nothing less than expected from a brand that has made their name producing rugged jogging and terrain strollers we will be dealing a lot more with this in a moment when we go over the mechanics but to start with here just know that due to the well built connection of the Front s wiggle wheel and an overall chassis structure oriented towards springy natural suspension you ll likely be tempted to use the spring on terrain that s a lot rougher than you should and as I ll explain in a moment this may lead to some problems now well one might argue that problems occurring from this from irresponsible consumer use are not exactly fair to fault the manufacturer with this doesn t mean that they won t occur in order to talk more about this though we must now move on to the mechanics looking at the spring top-to-bottom we re gonna go over the mechanics then and we remove the textiles in this case because we wanted you to see the overall structure of the chassis it s a bit different than a lot of other strollers most importantly because it does not have a rear frame crossbar so the Tula spring has a unique fold as you know and not having that crossbar is going to serve three positive functions as far as like the way they were thinking about the design of the store and we ll be able as positives before we get to the negatives of which there are several unfortunately so the positives of that are number one allows the stroller to fold down such that that rear frame contracts and thus the stroller takes up less space when it s folded down number two is that without a rear frame crossbar you actually have a very accessible shopping basket when the shopping basket is on there and that is a rare thing for three-wheeled strollers usually because you have the seat here and you also have a crossbar it can be a little bit difficult to get stuff into the shopping basket the third effect of not having that is that you re gonna have this sort of overall springy feeling because you have this court of sort of like tentpole or I don t know sailboat sail sort of tents I ll set up here on the sides I m just going to give it a bit of like natural suspension without having any large suspension units and while it s new and out of the box that tension is going to positively towards your driving experience of the spring okay now time for the things that are not quite so positive we re going to start with something sort of simple and that is this handle regulation mechanism now this is very common these days you can actually see it functioning with the textile off when I press on this button a wire that runs down the inside of this handle it s going to go right under the lip here is going to pull out this button and you have four different positions that is common these days it is still a complex system it is still something that breaks because where that wire is attached in particular up here near the handle can occasionally break it s attached to a plastic button right so you can sometimes have internal problems based on the complexity of that system but it s a commonly done thing these days so it s not a huge problem number two though these portions of the handle here that actually slot inside the other portion are relatively thin and even though there s an angle like the bar itself is angled in order to give stability it s angled here as well because it s thin and the sort of light goes in on the side that is a potential area for breakage if you have an accident in addition to the main bars of course potentially braking and we did see on even larger Toula models which are pretty sturdy and well constructed that sometimes because of the very lightweight aluminum that they use for their chassis construction you did some time get bending and breaking as a result of accidents that you would not get on other strollers made of heavier materials also regarding the handle you don t actually have a decent cross bar holding the handle in place you have this very thin bar which is responsible for holding the top portion of the seat on but there is already a lot of Gib right out of the box here and this very thin bar is riveted in on both sides here and this is one of the areas that I would suspect will weaken if not break early a few years down the line regarding this model okay moving down then to the actual central fold so it s activated here there s a safety button and you pull up on this handle which is very handy in use but the way it s actually put together is there are a pair of wires and those have to run all the way through that central handle and up into the central joints that lock in place so it s a second wire based system as we have higher up and this one also I believe is potential area for problems you get grit in there you can get asymmetries in the chassis because there are a lot of weak points which are gonna cause those wires to pull at different tensile strengths and so on and any sort of any time you have that sort of internal complexity you just have the potential for problems there s also a lot of riveting here it s a lot of riveting overall on the chassis so if you do have internal mechanical problems it s going to be difficult to take it apart and replace wires or replace any sort of small components that have broken every one have a little bit of a closer look at the lower rear frame on the stroller spring again and again the key theme here is that there is not that crossbar there so what that s going to do that is to put all the pressure onto these joints here these stabilization struts as well as here and it s quite firmly connected here right as well as put extra pressure on to where the wheels are because there s going to be some degree of horizontal movement right so all of that is going to create like wiggling where the wheels are connected and stuff the wheel connection is actually fine but this area here I feel needed to have been done a little bit more sturdily these are very thin bars that they have for support here and they are riveted it would have it would have been nice to see screws there so that you can tighten it if necessary what I d like to see something a little bit more heavy-duty in relation to these stabilization struts and I do think you re going to get weakening here here on both sides and I also think there s going to be a lot of kinetic energy put on to those wheels which could even though they re kind of well constructed and how they snap into place it could result in problems later on I would say overall just the lack of that back crossbar is going to accelerate the amount of looseness that occurs in the chassis in general if not braking itself unfortunately another negative effect on the rear frame of not having that crossbar is that they ve had to put a relatively complex wire base break system the wire has to run all the way up through here in order to get down the other side there s also no adjustment screw on such a long wire it s important to put adjustment screws when you have wire base break systems because over time as you re using the brakes there s like ten strip tension involved in brake lines between the internal wire of the brake line and the external part and after a while if you don t have an adjustment screw you can wind up with one wheel sort of not unlocking fully or not walking fully and you need to adjust that tension in the wire itself in order to keep it functioning well so that s another point and which longevity hasn t really been focused on in the overall construction of this kind of strange design yeah we re gonna have a little bit of a closer look at the lower front frame then and how the wheel connects in and stuff and I m actually quite a big fan of the way they ve done all of this I think that a lot of it is taken from their experience making jogging strollers and also making the the urban glide and stuff so it has some inbuilt suspension again has a nice large wheel it does have a swivel lock here on the side just a basic sort of set up for a swivel lock but it s built of no heavy duty in its construction and what I particularly like is the way they have fit the front axle into the front housing because it locks at the top and then it has multiple circumference --is here at the bottom where the plastic goes around the axle that are going to hold that axle in place and make sure that it doesn t move horizontally and damage the inside shaft of the front housing mechanism so as far as the front frame and the front wheel is concerned I think it s going to work quite well again both the front and the back wheels are a decent size for a stroller of this size you do have that suspension built from the basic structure of the chassis and you have the suspension the front so all of these elements as far as driving are concerned are going to suggest again that that you push this stroller a bit harder than all of those thinner riveted points and internally complex and fragile mechanisms so on will take in the long run so I think actually building it well in relation to the front wheel and the overall suspension white wind up kind of being its Achilles heel and will wear down the rest of the chassis at a quicker rate unfortunately so would I recommend getting the two the spring I would unfortunately say no probably not despite a few positive factors regarding driving and comfort of use I would say that the sub optimal seating setup combined with a variety of design choices which decrease the models longevity make the spring seem overpriced to me if one wanted to purchase a spring for light use for a few years it would probably hold up barring accidents but I definitely feel that there are better options for your money in any case we hope you enjoyed this video and if you did we asked you subscribe as it helps us to continue making videos

strollers to Disney yes 12 strollers with my three kids and in this video I m going to be sharing about the best Disney strollers from Singles to doubles whether you can bring wagons and Rider boards we re going to cover it all so keep Music watching if you re new here I m Emily I m the Stoller Mom I m a mom of three kids ages four and under and what makes my Channel Unique is I actually use the products with my three kids and give honest review from a mom s perspective if you haven t already be sure to subscribe to my channel it helps out so much and don t forget to like comment below with any questions and Shop through the links below cuz I do have a few discount codes for these strollers now before I jump into single strollers I do want to mention that I m going to cover a lot from Singles to doubles to wagons and more so be sure to check out the timestamps below if there s a specific section you re looking for the good news about single strollers is they are all approved at Disney so you don t have to worry about whether your stroller is approved like you do with wagons and doubles however there are certain things that make a single stroller better for Disney versus others now I will say I saw every stroller Under the Sun at Disney all different kinds of Brands so there are a lot of options to choose from but some things that make a really good Disney stroller are things like a good basket for storage a good canopy and a nice seat for those naps in the afternoon and one of those strollers that s really great for Disney and great for those of you with older kids is the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 this stroller can hold up to 65 PBS making it great for your older kids as well as has a good seatback and a really good recline for naps on the go I love how the footrest adjust best and comes up making it great for your child s naps my three-year-old who s 998th percentile had a great nap in this stroller it has a good canopy while the basket leaves a little to be desired you see these strollers all over Disney and with good reason you also can rent them which I ll talk about here in just a little bit but this is a great option for those of you with older kids another good single option that s good for those of you with little kids is the Mocking Bird single to double this is a great fullsize stroller it s actually the stroller I had when I had my first baby you can get a bassinet there s tons of accessories including an infant insert which is great and this stroller has an amazing basket holding 25 lbs I do have a code for this stroller as well that gets you a parent cup holder so check that out below but it gives you a lot of Versatility while still having a great canopy things like snack trays and is a really good option for Disney now let s say you don t want to do a fullsize stroll and you re looking for something more of a travel stroller something that s going to be great for your flight there and when you re at the parks well two really good options and they re both affordable are the Bombi BB V2 this stroller gives an amazing fold has a great canopy a good basket and a good push for a travel stroller we took this one all around Disney and I loved it I thought my baby was comfortable and it was great now I did wish there was a little bit of ventilation in the back of the seat when they were trying to take naps but I do have a full post on stroller fans so check that out below I do have one that s a misting fan and that one definitely helped and I also have a coupon code for this one where you can get a snack tray so check that out below as well now the biggest downside on the bombie is that is 18 lbs so if you want a lightweight stroller that you can just throw over your shoulder you may want to look at the Zoe tour the Zoe tour has a great canopy it also has a nice basket and a really easy fold it just folds right in half and it s very lightweight weighing only 13.2 lbs I love the snack tray and the accessories that Zoe has with their strollers and I have a 15 off code so check that out below so now that we ve talked about singles let s talk about double strollers because there are more limitations when it comes to double strollers at Disney but thankfully nowadays most sidebyside strollers are Disney approved they re under that 31 in wide and 52 in long so pretty much every side by-side double stroller you re going to be able to take the Disney but here are some options that I think are really good and I ll kind of break them out by each category now a really great double stroller option especially for those of you with older kids is the Bob double it is great for naps on the go has an amazing canopy and a really nice push and something that I found because Bobs are all over Disney is they have like a lower foot rest for your child that your older kids can also sit and rest their legs on now I m sure Bob does not recommend this so keep that in mind but I did talk to several parents who used that feature at Disney and they loved it now the story doesn t have the biggest storage so keep that in mind in getting a good parent organizer and I will say if you re having to take the transportation especially at Disney World keep in mind that the Bob does have a pretty big fold so just something to know another option that I was so excited and loved having at Disney was the menu Duo this stroller is brand new so I didn t have the snack Trace but hopefully when you buy it it will have the snack Trace so I ll link them below but this stroller offers a newborn ready recline which makes it great for your little ones at Disney not many side by sides offer this and so it s better than keeping your baby in a car seat being able to have that newborn ready recline is great for your baby on the go but also those of you who have older kids my four and a half-year-old who never naps in the stroller was able to lay down on this and some things that Uppa baby did really nicely that make it a great Disney stroller is they actually have like a mesh panel behind the seat that you can open for added air flow during naps they also have a place where you can put an air tag in the basket making it easier to find your stroller which I m actually making a video on because if you have a black stroller at Disney being able to identify your stroller is really important so check that out below now if you are going to be flying with the menu Duo I do recommend buying a travel bag and up a baby actually sells one with a warranty I know it is more money but it is worth the money to protect your stroller because Airlines do not take care of your stroller so I ll link another option below if you are taking a different double stroller and want that option but something to keep in mind and if you are flying to Disney and you want the best stroller for your trip to Disney you may want to look at the silvercross jet double this stroller is Compact and made for air travel it offers really plush padded seats and it s still going to do a great job at Disney with its nice basket make sure you get a parent organizer I ll link my favorite one below but this stroller is going to give you a lot of space and it s very lightweight under 20 lbs next this wouldn t be a best Disney stroller if we didn t talk about the Zoe twin the Zoe Trio and the Zoe quad now because wagons are not allowed at Disney the Zoe strollers allow you to transport more than one kid around the park at Disney they are approved and they make it so nice plus I m pretty sure the Zoe twin has one of the best baskets for Disney it s just nice and deep while it only holds 10 PBS I was able to load this basket up I also love the canopy and Zoe kills it in the accessories for Disney they have side bags you can add straps that make it easier to carry on Transportation now don t get me wrong when you re pushing the trio or the quad it s like pushing a boat but being able to transport multiple kids around Disney without having multiple strollers is so nice we used the trio with my three girls on our last day and it was a really good option oh and I have a 15 off code so check that out below I will say if you re going to use this for every day and you want to elevate your push I do think the allterrain wheels are worth it but it does make the stroller a little bit heavier now let s say you re looking for a stroller for one child and then the option for your other one to rest their legs well the juvie Caboose is a great option that is Affordable they have a few different options depending on features you re looking for but it also allows you to have a second child CL CL on and off as they need their legs rested and it is approved at Disney now let s talk about what things are not allowed at Disney there is a lot of debate on whether Rider boards are allowed at Disney and whether wagons are allowed at Disney in fact when I was there last week there were so many wagons now wagons are allowed at Disney when used for medical purposes so you will see a tag on many wagons that will say this however Disney was being very nice when I was there and I heard several people were allowed to bring it but only one time it was a one-time exception for some reason Disney does not allow wagons and I don t exactly know why I ve heard different things but it s something to keep in mind if you do not have a medical exemption for bringing your wagon you should not bring it because I also have Instagram DMS that say parents were forced to walk all the way back to their Airbnb 20 minutes or all the way back to the car which the parking is often not near the entrance to the park to store their wagon because Disney would not allow it so it really is at the discretion of the employee you re talking to and so one of the strollers I just me mentioned or renting a stroller is definitely going to be a better option than bringing your wagon when it comes to Rider board there s some debate according to Baby list they say in 2023 Rider boards were now allowed I saw them all over Disney but if you look on their website they say any trailer like object is not allowed at Disney what I will say is this one s a little bit more worth the risk for me and if you know if you re local to Disney and you have some insight please comment below and I ll pin it to the top but I think it s worth the risk because you can put it in your basket if you need to they re not as big and bulky and it could be a really great option for your older kids who need to rest their legs so if any of you have any insight on this let me know below all right so I just went over some great Disney strollers do you rent a Disney stroller do you rent from a third party company or do you buy your own honestly that s going to be different for every family now something I will say if you re looking at renting a stroller from the Disney parks I did rent one to try out and I would not recommend it the canopy is not good there s no seat recline no storage and it s honestly not a great push plus it s kind of expensive and I will say while I was there they actually ran out of doubles so if Dad was standing in in front of me with two little kids and he was not able to get he had to get two single strollers so just something to keep in mind I think a better option would be to rent through a third party which I actually have a blog post down below they have strollers like Baby Jogger Bob and juvie like the ones I just mentioned today you can also even rent like a Zoe Trio or quad and it ends up being almost the same price if not less than if you were renting from Disney and they deliver it right to your hotel or your Airbnb I hope this video was helpful let me know what questions you have below and don t forget to shop through the links below because I do have a lot of discount codes and I ll be sure to link my best Disney stroller fans parent organizers and accessories below thank you so much for watching
Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 Stroller,Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 Stroller Review - Babylist,How does the City Mini GT2 differ from the GT? Or the City Mini 2? We break it down and show you all the features of this easy to ...,dvhOLGOxHCA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvhOLGOxHCA,152134,296,2020-04-01T01:00:11Z,to be honest when I see multiple models of the same product and it s not totally obvious to me what the differences are I generally default for the cheaper option however I didn t decide to splurge and get the baby jogger city mini gt two stroller and I m here to show you how I liked it in April 20 19 babby jogger came out with updated versions of their city mini and their city mini gt which is why there s now a 2 on the end of their titles compared to the GT the GT 2 has lost a pound it now has calf support and on the peekaboo windows it has magnetic closures instead of velcro which kind of make me giddy but why the price difference between the two different models they re both considered City strollers but you can kind of think of it like the gt2 is the sports version of the city Mini 2 instead of having plastic wheels you get rubber foam filled tires and all wheel suspension the seat on the gt2 is also taller and has a higher weight limit than the City Mini 2 does which means that my one-year-old has a lot of room to grow and so does my three-year-old when it comes to durability the box says it has uncompromising agility on any terrain which is a tad dramatic but I will say it was surprisingly lightweight and I could easily one hand push the stroller on sidewalks gravel or grass the fold is one of the most outstanding and loved features about this stroller it is so easy to do and it really does only take one hand it s also nice and compact so it doesn t take up much trunk or storage space the only bummer about the fold is that it doesn t stand up one of them the material on the seat is nice and breathable although it s not machine washable I did appreciate that there aren t a lot of cracks or crevices for food to fall into keep in mind this seat is not modular meaning you cannot change the direction that your baby is facing but you can adjust the recline to be almost completely flat and so you can pop up the calf rest it s almost like you re pushing around a baby lazy boy if you d like to start using the gt2 with your newborn you have a lot of different options you can pretty much find an adapter for any infant car seat but if you wanted to use the Baby Jogger City Go infant car seat the adaptors for that one are included in your stroller purchase the only thing I ll mention is that while researching I found that some parents had trouble folding this stroller with the Chico peg pair go roller adapter hopefully I said that right while you re out and about you can adjust the handlebar to whatever is comfortable for you and you ll find the handbrake right up here the canopy is nice and big but the storage basket is pretty small compared to some other single strollers I ve tried it is helpful to be able to access things from the front when you lift up the calf breast though on the accessory front there are a lot of different things you can choose from but I would definitely consider purchasing a parent console because there s no cup holder or place for your phone overall if you re someone with a middle-of-the-road budget who s looking for an easy to operate and compact stroller you might love the city mini gt too as much as we did and if you re still doing research be sure to check out fabulous best stroller guides for more options happy registering Music
Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 Stroller,Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 Stroller Review,We purchased and reviewed the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 stroller along with the top 20 lightweight ...,yR4_qDnuARw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR4_qDnuARw,15708,90,2023-06-06T22:09:22Z,the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 Bridges the gap between a full-sized full-featured everyday stroller and a lightweight stroller at 20b it s priced reasonably at around 400 that s a great price given that you can use it for infants with the included car seat adapter all the way up to Children 65 lb or 44 in tall we love the folding it takes just 1 second to fold and you can do it with one hand unfolding takes two seconds and it s possible with one hand but easier than with two if you want to stand it up for storage it s easy to take off the front wheel the storage basket is pretty big but you have to navigate under the bar going across the back or go through the side it does have a pocket on the back for smaller items there s a big peekaboo window that closes with a magnet it has a sturdy and comfortable rubber handle that s adjustable from 36 to 44 in high it was the only adjustable handle in the 20 lightweight strollers we compared the parking brake is on the handle compared to regular brake pedals this takes some time to get used to the harness straps are a little Annoying to adjust and they have to be rethreaded to raise the shoulder height it s a fairly easy rethread though the Buckle operation isn t as smooth as some strollers but not too bad the seat reclines and raises easily and goes back a decent amount there s a nice ventilation option why must I buy a cup holder separately we compared ride smoothness and the GT2 has one of the least bumpy rides in part that s because of the large Wheels with rubber Treads and three-wheel suspension it steers and Maneuvers easily on and off the sidewalk and we found that it performs better off-road than most other strollers it also stays on course on long straight walks but you can also lock the front wheel the GT2 is comfortable with thick seat padding and an extendable footrest it doesn t sit as upright as we would like the canopy offers pretty full Su protection although there are some strollers with canopies that go down farther you can buy a snack tray and cup holder separately the city mini GT2 has a sturdy frame and high quality materials like other strollers made by Baby Jogger in our sound testing the GT2 had one of the lowest average decible level readings we didn t find any pinch points that concern us the GT2 probably because of its wide rear wheelbase was less likely to tip over sideways than other strollers in our tip over test although the extra width is a problem getting through small doorways here s a quick list of what we like and don t like first easy folding smooth steering and better than average on bumpy terrain size for big kids and we don t like the bar across the back the less than upright seat and it s pretty big when folded if you like this please like And subscribe
Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 Stroller,Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 Stroller Review Top 5 Parent Questions Answered - Babylist,Here are the 5 most common questions we ve heard about the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 Stroller 0 00 1 Is it really that easy to ...,gfma-wioAHs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfma-wioAHs,26981,107,2021-09-28T01:00:13Z,here are the five most common questions we ve heard about the baby jogger city mini gt2 stroller number one is it really that easy to fold yep you really only need to use one hand to fold this stroller which matters most when your hands are full and trust me they ll pretty much always be full to be fair though i ve had a few years of stroller folding experience so i thought i d let my neighbors give it a try neighbors that have not folded a stroller in several years and even they were able to figure it out pretty quickly just keep in mind there are a few things to do before you fold one release the lock on the front swivel wheel otherwise it ll keep it from collapsing flat and two adjust the handlebar all the way up otherwise the stroller won t stand up on its own once folded question number two can it really handle all terrains let me show you we cruised sidewalks streets grass gravel wood chips and that was just getting to and from the playground you ll notice a slight difference between smooth sidewalks and more unpredictable terrain like grass of course but the built-in suspension helps it feel more like gliding than pushing the forever air tires are also small but mighty they re designed to never go flat and i d say the three wheel design also really helps with the maneuverability or at least it feels easier to pull off cool moves like this on to question number three how long can you use it the stroller seat is designed to be used once your baby can sit up on their own which could be around six months but the major perk about the gt2 is that there are adapters available for so many different infant car seats britax kiko peg perego kleck cybex great go maxi cosi and even baby jogger s own pram or infant car seat the gt2 actually comes with the city go 2 adapters already in the box question number four does it have a reversible seat no it does not the gt2 seat stays facing forward as in it s not modular if you purchase the pram or use the stroller as a travel system baby will face you but then after that they get to sit forward and face the world they ll also get to kick up their feet on the nice calf rest recline nearly flat and enjoy strolling beneath the shade of a massive canopy with lots of visibility i m totally jealous lastly question number five is it worth it it s totally up to you of course but for reference premium features like all-wheel suspension are usually reserved for strollers that cost nearly twice as much as the gt2 so while you might not get the leather detailing or extra large storage basket you will be getting a solid combination of features that you won t generally find in other strollers under 400 the list of car seat adapters and compatible accessories is impressive the variety of color options available just keeps growing and the handful of go-to features parents crave in an everyday stroller make this a promising choice whether you re a city or suburban family hope this helps Music
Bugaboo Fox 5 Stroller,Bugaboo Fox 5 Review Best Full-Size Strollers 2023,In this video we review the Bugaboo Fox 5 premium single stroller option. It s a top-tier pick that is suitable from birth up to 50lbs.,jKFUxSnElhY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKFUxSnElhY,57098,362,2023-05-02T18:04:24Z,the Fox 5 is bugaboo s latest single stroller release that has a bunch of updates from the previous generations of the fox to make it one of the best strollers that you ll find this thing has been wildly impressive since we first started using it a few weeks back so let s get a closer look at the Bugaboo Fox 5. so the first thing to note is it s kind of a bigger stroller weighing in anywhere between 23 to 28 pounds ish depending on the configuration that you re using and it can take kids up to 50 pounds now out of the box a seat frame came fitted with the bassinet setup which you ll need to install a couple extra pieces before Usage Now this isn t something that we use too much because our baby was a little bit older but just to show you some Basics here it s got great depth and width it offers a good amount of airflow by lifting the flaps around the front and the sides now converting it from a bassinet to the seat does take some time and assembly it took me about 15 minutes or so ish it s a little cumbersome but what I will say is that there are some steps that make the transition much easier compared to previous generations of the fox and it s also important to note that you re likely not going to be in the habit of switching back and forth between bassinet and seat very consistently so I don t expect you to make that transition over and over again it s kind of a one and done thing now I really like the seat frame serves multiple purposes and there s not much that you have to store whereas some other brands provide you a full bulky bassinet that you ll need to keep elsewhere when not in use with the Bugaboo it s just the fabric and a couple small pieces so very nice there the seat itself measures about 12 and a half inches wide and has a height of about 35 inches at its longest and should comfortably fit kids up to three four years of age around there and it kind of depends on how big your kids are there s obviously going to be variants and new for the Fox 5 is the ability to slightly adjust the foot rest to add or take away about two inches as needed in addition to the height of canopy being able to adjust as well now the canopy I really like they come in a variety of colors you can unzip the panel at the top for extended Sun coverage and I m really impressed with how far down it can go to offer almost full coverage with the exception of the legs kind of dangling down it s one of the best extensions that I ve seen now getting a look at the straps of the seat you know they re not magnetic like a lot of the ones that I ve been recently using but it s not a big deal because this does two things very well number one it s super easy to use and I never run the risk of really clipping my fingers too many times that s happened because the clips were designed poorly not an issue here second much like the butterfly which I reviewed in the past and still stands as my favorite compact stroller definitely go check out that review Bugaboo butterfly much like the butterfly the straps remain in an open position so it s easier to get your kids seated and buckled without having to fish for of the straps behind them absolutely love the thought behind that design and then very quickly behind the seat near the top is the lever to engage the one-handed recline good range of motion there now at the top is a telescoping handlebar which has one of the larger adjustments and range that I ve seen being able to go from about 36 inches to roughly 43 inches in height which is both taller and shorter than something like the upper baby Vista which is also another premium option in a similar price range now you do this by pressing both the bottom and front buttons on the handlebar at the same time and then adjusting as needed now if parents have a vast difference in height you know Mom is small dad is super tall that s not going to be a problem with this stroller really good range of height here now when it is at its lowest while keeping the buttons pressed you can enable the fold by simply giving it a little bit of force to start the collapse and that leads to another noteworthy update with the fox 5. with the fold on this model it s now a truly one-handed fold once the handlebar is down you can move forward and grab the crossbar and with a slight lift it ll complete the fold and maintain a self-standing position now its profile isn t as Slim or as compact as other options that we ve used in the past making it a little bit awkward to lift and load into the trunk of a car but again the Fox 5 is one of the larger full-size single options that you re gonna find which makes it great for comfort and usage for your children and and strolling around but it does come at the cost of not having the most compact form when folded moving on the frame is very well made time will tell how visible scratching will be as we keep using this so stay tuned for like a comparison video that will make down the line viewers often ask about the differences between you know budget friendly options and premium options like this one mainly can you tell the difference between two if you were to give them both the push yes you would definitely feel a difference in the material and note the sturdiness of a well-made stroller like the fox 5. now when it comes to the actual push this is arguably the smoothest stroller that we ve pushed and one where my wife herself like she instantly knew like when she pushed it she was like all right bugaboo s different here like this this is a beast again super smooth ride and that s in large part due to the size of the wheels which can handle different terrain much better than other options uh including grass gravel and Cobblestone roads as Bugaboo is a European brand and definitely made to tackle more than just Suburban sidewalks it s got a slightly wider footprint but still handles incredibly well and feels pretty Nimble for its size we ve recently been taking it along to soccer games where we ve had to make our way through Turf and grass sometimes muddy and both the push and the suspension have felt great Bugaboo also updated the wheels with axles that are less prone to bending and improve the wheel Forks to prevent wobbling and wear over time now one personal note about the frame is that I noticed that the gap between the handlebar and where the seat is located is a little bit wider than I m used to but we quickly learned that that could serve as an extra storage spot for particularly lawn chairs when we ve taken our kids to sporting events so that s one way that we unlocked a secret Advantage uh is that how it was supposed to be used is that what it was designed for probably not uh but it works as we round things out at the bottom is a large storage basket that can accommodate all of your Essentials the back flap can be oriented up or down but I will note that over time it might be prone to a little bit of warping as it is made to be flexible while the basket can also be accessed from the front it is a little bit more difficult than accessing from the rear as the leg rest doesn t pivot upward so that might be in your way a little bit so overall this is easily a top of the line stroller that delivers exceptional performance and versatility and I would not hesitate to make this blur charge on this if you re actively shopping though you really need to ask yourself like is this actually worth it for me like I already mentioned earlier it is larger a little bit heavier so great comfort for your kids great for grocery shopping and whatnot while I think that it is perfectly suitable for Suburban living you might favor something Slimmer if your lifestyle you know that it caters more to a run and Gun type daily routine you know so that is something to be considered I d say the fox Hive is probably more ideal for SUV and Van owners and it s definitely one to be considered if you live in a place where you re going to need a little bit more terrain capability like uh like snow grassy fields and gravel Trails again Fox 5 is a top tier pick absolutely loved getting to review this if you found this video helpful hit that like button for me and if you know any new or expectant dads be sure to check out dadverb.com where you ve got courses to prep guys through pregnancy and guide them through the entire first year of fatherhood

mom.,idIlMP6osvk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idIlMP6osvk,29490,109,2020-04-07T14:57:01Z,hey everyone its Holly from baby gizmo and today we re taking a look at the mountain buggy Nano this is a super travel friendly shoulder that folds up into a tiny little package but it also has some great big features so let s take a look let s start with the seat this seat has a weight capacity of up to 44 pounds that s about a four or a five year old it is 13 and a half inches wide with an 18 inch seat back and a measurement from the back of the seat to the top of the canopy of 27 inches so even though it s a really compact stroller the seat is rather large now there is an adjustable padded five-point harness in the seat and what I love is that my buggy has these hard to do buckles easy for Mom but almost impossible for the toddler to do and that s because the two-step process you with one hand you have to push with your thumb those two red buttons then squeeze something that toddlers just can t master and I love to execute them in the seat now there is an adjustable cap laid rest here that you can have up when it s smaller baby where you squeeze right in front here and it goes down to the comfort of your child there s also a little step right here that your child can set their feet now the seat does have a recline but I love this and travel strollers because kids like to take naps on the go so we have a one-handed strap system right here you re gonna push a little button pull back one of those infantry clients that wherever you stop that s where they recline is gonna stop and it goes all the way back to there and back is a very deep recline for a trial stroller but it s not flat so here s the thing if you re going to put a child right here in the seat you re it s going to be six months enough but then they included these straps over here to accommodate an infant car seat to turn it into a travel system and it works with most major brands because they re still clip-on adapter it s just this strap right here if you re gonna wrap it around the car seat to keep it into place you re on have your seat reclined and your footrest out so you can use it from birth with the with an infant car seat which is great now the back of the seat this is what I really like is that this is a whole mesh window allowing air to circulate through the seats keep your child cool and it also lifts up like that velcro on the back so you could stuff it up here if you wanted a lot more air now this piece right here this fabric is sewn to the seat so that s not something you re going to be able to bend over the reason they do that it s a safety measure so the child doesn t actually slide up and out of the seat but that being said I m glad it has it s 18 inch defects not too bad so if you haven t really told child s their head is just gonna come up like this but as you can see it has a lot of give so that s okay I just like to mention that though but this does not come out of the way but again it s a safety measure and this comes down like this I love this big mesh window now there s no peekaboo window but this is your peekaboo window so I like that a lot so let s go down to the basket so that s another Nano it s not ginormous but you know what I never expect to stuff a huge diaper bag in a travel stroller I m in a decent size for a travel stroller I m gonna put that up now I have the travel bag down there I m going to show you this in a second because this is awesome um there is the basket you can access it from the front and you can kind of access it from the back for small items like I said you re not gonna fit a huge diaper bag in there but you re gonna get quite a bit of you know baby essentials so it s a decent sized basket I m not painting on it so that is the basket and let s talk about these wheels the wheels are Evo tires and they are five inches in front and in back the front ones are 360 degree swivel wheels they have the ability to lock straight all you have to do is push this red button down and that is gonna lock them straight for a little bit of all terrain this is not an all-terrain stroller but if you want to take it on grass gravel or a playground mulch you re gonna laugh those front wheels just to kind of prevent it from getting caught up in every bump so the front wheels do live the rear wheels like they are also five and a half inches there isn t one step break all you have to do is set down on the red part to lock it into place and then step on the blue part to let it go free so really really good oh and there s also rear wheel suspension so you do have a little bit of both absorption it s not like I like to call it in the back so let s talk about this canopy is e2p on canopy with a pop-up Sun Visor no it s not the biggest canopy on the market but it s pretty good for a travel stroller like I said no peekaboo window but that s okay because yeah this whole mesh window in the back that allows you to pick in at your child if you need to the handlebars are called handlebar it is not adjustable it s 40 inches around where I place my hands I am five five so it is fine with me put a little bit of put heels on that s still okay for me it has a runway strap I don t know where you re going that you need the runway strap I guess if you re in you know San Francisco and walking you might need it but this is usually reserved or a jogging stroller so when you re going around fast and gets away from you but just know hey we have the runaway strap on the nail so that is that so I guess it is time to fold it because this is the best part of it the fact that this stroller is so compact oh and it s so lightweight it weighs under 13 pounds so super easy to travel with but the compact folded package is so small that you can take it as carry-on in onto most airplanes and I think most because I m sure there s no ball through their our collection but it does fit the requirement I m most curious oh what s so great about that is people like what s okay what s the matter you just gonna have to do you don t check it at the gate the problem is is once you leave your stroller with the baggage handlers store they look nice they re probably very nice people but yeah you know they re dropping it they re throwing it I know I ve heard stories of strollers getting broken even in nature and even though they re handing it to you as you walk off the plane you don t know what happened in between so this is a great option to keep it with you you just take it on the plane you put up in the overhead bin and you good to go so let s go ahead and fold it okay folding and it does require two hands but it s easy to do there are two buttons on the inside the canopy right there you push up and the handlebar will fold down like that discussion grab the handle right here and it folds down now there is an automatic lock but sometimes you do have to push it together in order to get it to engage there is a strap right here you could fling it right over your shoulder and weighing less than 13 pounds very very manageable very lightweight and look at how cute and small this kind of got packages very very tiny like that you could carry it like this as well kind of like a briefcase I suppose and another like I said there is a travel bag so and you know simple - so here is your travel bag and the trouble banquets rate you just put it over the wheels actually stick out of the travel bag okay so here it is in the travel bag you lock those front wheels straights the wheels do stick out look at that now there s a reason for that first of all you can carry it just like this like I said a briefcase but there s a strap you can throw that over your shoulder like that or there s a third way you can do it because those are exposed and they ll have to replace it you could we look behind you like luggage if you just didn t want to walk with it so rip really great great for travel I love this travel bag I m like I said so small they can fit in the overhead bin of an airplane of most airplanes I m so setting it back up that s easy to do all you have to do is take off the bag now remember the automatic lock on the locket grab that handle like that everything locks into place and you were ready to go very very easy now as you can see the mouth is a great travel stroller not only do you have a large seat but it the compact fold is so small that you can put it in the overhead bin of most airplanes and I love that now the NATO it retails for 199 dollars which isn t too bad for a great travel stroller that s really lightweight and can kind of go on the go with you um so that s it what did you like about the NATO leave me a comment and let me know and don t forget to

Check it out here ...",44kJzAjeIaQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44kJzAjeIaQ,110698,95,2022-03-15T23:00:22Z,Music this is the upper baby vista v2 a full-size convertible stroller that can support up to three kiddos with a smooth ride and a slew of high-end details and accessories for around a thousand bucks you get all of this the stroller frame and wheels bassinet attachment bug shield bassinet storage bag the toddler seat attachment another bug shield and a rain shield too for reference that is a lot of included accessories so let s get into the stroller options you can stroll with one two or three babies of various ages and stages as a single you can start strolling from birth with the included bassinet or attach your own infant car seat with a separate car seat adapter unless you go with the uppababy mesa that connects without one then once baby can sit up on their own they can enjoy the toddler seat until they reach 50 pounds let s say you have two babies like twins congratulations by the way then you re in luck unlike other doubles say the mockingbird stroller the vista v2 can support two bassinets or two infant car seats at the same time you ll just need to purchase the extra bassinet now if you have two babies of different ages like i did you may be able to carry them both at once with what s right in the box at first but you ll likely end up buying a second seat or a rumble ride along with a set of adapters for when you have two toddlers and if you add a third to the bunch also like i did that s where the piggyback stroller board comes in having so many options can be cool but also a little confusing like you may not realize right away that there are different adapters for the upper and lower levels or that the second seat actually has a lower weight limit than the included toddler seat that being said uppa has an expansion tool on their website to help you visualize it all better while planning and once you ve found the configuration and accessories you like it s easy to get into the groove from day to day as for the stroller adjustments the toddler seat is modular so you can flip it forward or rear-facing and then you can recline it to whichever angle is most comfy for your little one just keep in mind that depending on how you line up the seats you may not be able to fully recline one of the seat as much as the other the ventilated and expandable canopies on both the bassinet and toddler seat have great visibility and airflow and on the toddler seat the canopy is height adjustable which is really helpful for taller kiddos like my lennox the storage basket is impressively large as in it can hold 20 more pounds of stuff than other comparable double strollers like the nuna demigrow and it s pretty easy to access despite the big bar going across the opening there s also a telescoping handlebar which is great for caretakers of varying heights and the stroll is really smooth and durable you can feel the premiumness here the shock shock-absorbing all-wheel suspension glides and turns with ease even as you add more kids and accessories pro tip for you parents with multiples put your heavier kiddo in the back seat parents have said it s really hard to steer with the weight mostly up front now having said that you do have the option to lock the front wheels for a little extra oomph as you manage the added weight or if you re riding on a rougher terrain speaking of weight like most double strollers the v2 is on the heavier side but you ll only need to worry about that for the few seconds that you re folding it down and loading it into the trunk otherwise you can just let it stand up on its own and once it s folded down with the toddler seat attached it s still relatively compact i ll wrap things up by saying the obvious this is a good looking stroller the real leather accents the great variety of color options it s almost hard to choose but what s cool is up a baby will send you four swatches of fabric for free to see which one you like the best before you buy they also offer a three year warranty and a travel safe program that covers damages if you register and gate check your stroller inside of the travel bag the looks are also functional the toddler seat has easy to adjust no re-thread harness straps and the bassinet has water-repellent aerated mattress that s so comfy you could even buy a separate stand and use it as a full-time newborn sleep space overall the uppababy vista v2 is a versatile beautiful workhorse an investment yeah worth it that s up to you i hope this helps Music you
UPPAbaby VISTA V2 - Stroller,UPPAbaby VISTA V2 Review Best Stroller Travel System,This is a review of the UPPAbaby VISTA V2 and it is arguably the best stroller and travel system for your baby or toddler s . In this ...,euyHcgiY2eU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euyHcgiY2eU,354632,4223,2020-08-06T17:15:01Z,the upper baby vista is one of the most popular and highly rated strollers you ll find and new for 2020 is the vista v2 so let s go look at the stroller find out how it compares to older versions and i ll answer that question is it worth that 1000 price tag Music hey guys andrew here with dad virb and this video is brought to you by pish posh baby pish posh is your source for finding baby gear from brands including nuna bugaboo and more today we re diving into the uppababy vista v2 which you can find linked below let s start with the basic functions and then i ll get into my thoughts on this one main reason the vista attracts so many parents is its build quality and overall longevity this is a stroller meant to last you through multiple kids over the course of several years in fact before reviewing baby gear on this channel this was our very first stroller back in 2017 and we re still using it to this day it can expand to a double and accommodate two kids and with the addition of the piggyback accessory you can actually haul up to three kids which makes this extremely versatile now that note some of the biggest updates made for the v2 were largely centered around the seats the main toddler seat on the v2 is slightly larger with a higher 20 inch seat compared to the 19 incher from previous versions and it also has a deeper two and a half inch foot rest versus the two inches from the older gen they also introduced a non-rethread harness complete with straps that adjust a bit easier than before now one of the most notable changes has been the redesigned canopy and it is near perfect with older models the extended sunshade was tucked into the canopy which was convenient but it was also flimsy and it didn t offer that much more coverage with the v2 the canopy is made up of three panels most of the time the canopy will be extended to its standard two panel form but you can now unzip and expand that third panel and get that full coverage along with some extra airflow through a mesh window to expand the vista to a double you ll need to pick up the rumble c and adapters now what you re not seeing in this footage are the upper adapters which is just another thing to buy we didn t get that they do help with more legroom for the toddler seat but you can get away without it i will say you do need them if you are putting on the infant car seat though now that said it is important to note the differences between the toddler seat and the rumble seat which is smaller the toddler seat can accommodate kids up to 50 pounds whereas the rumble seat maxes out at only 35 pounds so if you have twins at some point when they get older one will sit a little bit more comfortably than the other now if you re not having twins this is ideal for two kids also i mentioned it before but the piggyback is a huge favorite of ours for us we most often go with the toddler seat and piggyback for our oldest as opposed to going with the double seats obviously the rumble seat and piggyback are extra accessories they don t come with the stroller but what does come included is the bassinet it s suitable for infants up to 20 pounds and it is rated sleep safe when used with their bassinet stand now from what i ve seen parents are split on whether or not they want to use the bassinet or just stick with the infant car seat the bassinet is great for maintaining that flat back positioning for spinal development and open airways while the infancy is super convenient with regards to moving the baby from the car to your stroller regardless of your preference it is nice that the bassinet is included though some may just set it aside unused on that note let s chat about car seats without the adapter the vista can take the uppababy mesa car seat which is what we mostly used for our first two kids it s great unless bundled it does come separate and it ll run you about 300 bucks now most parents i see will go in that direction for the mesa but if you re eyeing other options you can pick up their adapter which can accommodate the following infant car seats my favorite on this list being the nuna pipa lite lx that said i am partial to sticking with products under the same brand umbrella so i just recommend getting the mesa as it is the native option i want to note that i ve talked a bit about accessories adapters and whatnot it s annoying that these things cost so much extra but it is nice to know that upper baby has a large range of extras that you can pick up on their site also whatever works for the v2 will also work for the vista models from 2015 and up and as a quick plug buying the vista or any of its accessories through the link below helps support this channel and it s at no additional cost to you guys so if you do end up going with the vista please consider buying through there it is how i stay afloat and it s what keeps my camera rolling for you guys moving on let me briefly hit on the fold on either side of the frame are triggers which you ll need to pull to initiate the fold it is an easy motion and after having tested a bunch of strollers i have a big appreciation for how slim the fold actually is i love the footprint especially when comparing it to the mockingbird or the glue go complete it can fold with both seats on there but sometimes the open can stick a bit personally i just take the second seat off when getting it into the trunk also it can get pretty heavy if you don t the stroller and seat weighs roughly 27 pounds so it is on par with other full sizes in the category the frame itself is made of aluminum and magnesium having flown with the vista multiple times across the us i can attest that it can take hits and it can stand up to those ever so gentle airport baggage handlers but bonus tip if you use uppababy s travel bags for the mesa cruise or vista and register it on their site any damage will be fully covered under their travel safe program so it s a very cool thing that not too many people are talking about at the very top of the frame you ve got a nice leather covered telescoping handlebar which is great for parents of differing heights and moving all the way down the basket got a sleek remodel for the v2 it does remain large and can carry up to 30 pounds of cargo and it includes a storage pocket for smaller carry-along items like your phone and wallet it can be accessed from both the front and rear but one thing i do have to comment on is i ve never been a fan of that crossbar cutting the basket in half it creates an inconvenient divide which has always been an annoyance for larger bags and items now it s not actually an issue i m just annoying and i wish it was a little bit more open like mockingbirds or the nuno demi grows rounding it out let s take a look at the polyurethane wheels it s measuring at eleven and a half inches for the rear and eight inches at the front so same as last year but new for the v2 the tires are softer and the new spring action all-wheel suspension system has been redesigned for a smoother ride on all types of terrain i ll circle back to the feel of the stroller in a moment but just know that this thing glides also new for 2020 is a wheel lock indicator for the front wheels and to cap everything off or the brakes which haven t really changed from older generations it hasn t needed to it s great as is it s a single pedal break with a color indicator to tell you if the break is active so those are all the basic functions color wise you ve been looking at the emmett color style upper babies rolled out a bunch of new colors for 2020 they always seem to be rotating those they ve got great neutrals have a look you ll you ll definitely find something for you now the important part beyond the functions let s get into the buying decision if budget is of no concern i would honestly say get the vista for me it s easily one of the best overall daily drivers that you ll find and it is as close to a perfect stroller as you can get now for those on the fence should i get it should i not this part is for you if you re wondering if the added cost is worth it it is subjective but i would say yes now if you re really trying to stretch that budget and you know that spending over a thousand dollars for the vista and mesa that that s gonna hurt then stop watching don t worry about it google the even flow pivot expand or the mockingbird stroller and then just run with those you ll probably get more value out of the evenflo expand because it does come with that safe max infant car seat either way you re going to be happy with one of those they are a wonderful budget friendly options and you should not feel bad about missing out on something like the vista it s a sentiment that i hear often please don t feel that it s a stroller the other options that i mentioned are great that said the question i often get is why would i spend over a grand when i can just go with the even flow or mockingbird for half the price and be happy and i could point to a couple things to answer that but the main thing is it s all in the details that make the vista a technically more sound and just better option the push is like no other it s the smoothest stroller i ve pushed and it s simply better with terrain versatility suspension turns in single-handed operation the fold is slimmer and somehow has less bulk than the mockingbird despite having the same size the form factor is just more buttoned up here it s easier to get in and out of the back of your car and for whatever reason i pinch my fingers less the customer support warranty and travel safe program all ensure an already remarkably strong stroller and to dovetail that last note the thing that i see most often is that there are times when people have gone with the graco kiko or evenflo option and have come away unhappy for one reason or another they always say they ended up splurging for the vista and never looked back no pain of having to get something fixed or unhappy with the quality they wish they would have just gone with the vista in the first place and called it a day so you are guaranteed a quality starter the way that the pelicans saw zion in the draft i have to end on the basketball reference guys lebron jordan the

Graco Modes Element Stroller,GRACO STROLLER HONEST REVIEW GRACO MODES ELEMENT TRAVEL SYSTEM,This video is not sponsored. Stroller - Thank you for watching! I appreciate the support! If you want to stay ...,dpBDDTl7ckc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpBDDTl7ckc,114266,1867,2021-01-10T14:00:10Z,hey guys welcome back to my channel today i am going to do a review on the graco modes element um travel system stroller so if you want to hear my honest review please just keep on watching okay so here is the stroller and again the name of the stroller is the graco modes element travel system i have it in the color canter it comes in a variety of different colors this stroller is under three hundred dollars so it s very very affordable Music Music Music so right now i m showing you how easy and how simple it is to fold up it just takes one little button push up and then same thing for opening it up it s literally a one step setup it has a nice big canopy cup holder and the snack tray comes off and on Music so right now i m just going to show you how the actual seat can turn around so it can be a front-facing seat or it can be rear-facing meaning that it faces the person pushing the stroller so if you want your child to look at you instead of looking out into the world you can change it and it was so simple for me to just flip it around and then you can put the cup holder and snack tray on this way as well Music so you can in fact use it as just a frame for your baby carrier and this frame is aluminum so it s very Music lightweight Music so if you didn t want to have the toddler seat on and you just had an infant then you could also use the stroller this way Music again the baby carrier has a nice big canopy to protect baby from the sun Music and this baby carrier can also be front facing or rear facing so literally you re just popping it off flipping it around and popping it back on just in case you want baby to look out at the world if they re a little bit older Music Music Music so right now i m showing you that you can use the toddler seat and the carrier um if you want baby extra protected because you can in fact pull up both canopies so that the actual car seat is a hundred percent covered and there s no you know light getting in no sun getting in and your baby s just 100 covered so this is actually how i use it mostly because my baby s little so just to cover him up completely i actually use it with the toddler seat just because i want to use that canopy for extra protection and it has a little flap here so you can look in on them it has a cup holder for the parent as well as a snack tray it has a lot of storage at the bottom Music so so now i m showing you how the toddler seat can actually sit up completely i had it leaned back reclining but your toddler can sit up all the way and then you can actually release it all the way down so that it becomes a bassinet and i m going to show you how it becomes a bassinet right now Music i want you to stay tuned to the end though and i will tell you my personal pros and cons on this stroller so i am going to demonstrate using my sun so i can just imagine you know on a nice warm day lay a blanket in there lay baby in there and baby can nap while you are out maybe taking a walk so they don t have to be in their carrier if they are a baby they can just kind of lay in the bassinet portion Music and i am going to flip it around so that you can see that baby can in fact face the mother too in case you don t want them looking out and you want to look at them while they re in the bassinet so like i said stay tuned and then i m going to go into my pros and cons next so these are my pros and cons um and they re in no particular order they re just let s just start from the top my pros it s lightweight it s a one set folding and unfolding which means you press one button or you pull up one little latch and it folds up and it opens up easy it s not a lot of steps in order to you know get it to go in your car it also has multiple step seating options one has an infancy a bassinet and a stroller seat you can also buy um just the stroller if you don t want the car seat but honestly it s more affordable to get the stroller and the car seat in one so that s why we got the entire travel system also i like that each seating option can be either rear facing or front facing so you can actually take any of the seating options and you can flip them around again i like that it has a cup holder and a snack tray for the toddler seat that was so important to me i saw so many strollers that did it and i m like y all kids don t be snacking while y all out and about so but this one does and i like it and you can remove it very easily also i like that it has a cup holder for the parent um so that i can put my drink and it has it has a little snack tray for me but the cup holder is very important for me to have i like that it has large canopies on both the actual stroller and the car seat has like canopies that like go far over to block the sun i m really big on aesthetics and looks i like that it s black and dark gray i feel like that it s easy to clean so i like the color i like that it was affordable because baby some of these strollers are um you know six hundred to a thousand dollars and that wasn t in my budget so i like that it s affordable and i like that it was an easy setup like i mean easy like taking it out of the box and setting it up completely because i did it when i was pregnant and i did it by myself and it was easy so those are my pros ready for my cons not too many cons one of the cons is it s i mean when you have the toddler seat on it it s bulky like it takes up my entire space in my trunk and i mean i m sure car seats do i mean strollers do take up a lot of space in your trunk but this one is once you have the toddler seat it s really big and bulky it s lightweight i m sorry that was a pro i could have said it is lightweight but it s also bulky also i wish the snack tray for the adult was deeper so that i could put my phone in but it s just very like flat and it just has like a little bit so like if you put your phone in and hit a bump your phone could fall out and there s also no option for a double stroller i know that a lot of single strollers also have options to add on so that you can make it a double or so that you can have the toddler seat and the car seat go together this one does not so if you do have multiple children this is not the option for you because it s just a single stroller when we have more kids i m going to need to look into another stroller so that is something to consider but anyway overall i love this stroller i just recommend this stroller on all levels especially if you guys are just starting out and don t want to pay a ton for a stroller all right guys if you re still watching thank you you are awesome you are amazing i love the support if you like

Graco Modes Element Stroller,"3 POPULAR GRACO Strollers COMPARED! Pramette, Nest Nest2Grow","We re comparing 3 popular Graco Modes strollers to determine what s best for YOU and YOUR FAMILY! Then, join in as we round ...",_-cmUHA_h-M,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-cmUHA_h-M,130914,703,2023-02-21T23:00:18Z,Graco strollers are some of the most popular strollers on the market but how do you know which one fits your needs we are going to be comparing three of the most popular strollers in the Graco modes line the Graco modes premet Graco modes nest and the Graco modes The Nest to grow we ve worked with BaByliss gear editors to compare these strollers in three expert curated categories longevity portability and features we ve even tested them ourselves to see how they stack up in real life so let s see which one s best for you now let s talk about longevity or how long you re going to use these strollers starting with the Graco modes premet so this one you can use from birth because it turns into a pram all the way up until 50 pounds so Daniel s going to show us how it turns into a pram you just pop down the seat there s a strap and once you pop that through you can do the same thing with the other strap towards the headrest and lower that so this will lie flat and baby has as a bassinet to lay in in order to turn it to a toddler sleep as your baby grows you just pull up the strap by the headrest and do the same on the bottom for the seat pop it up and then you have a toddler seat bam all right next up we have the Graco modes Nest this one you can also use from birth up to 50 pounds here s the toddler seat and Daniel will show us how to break it down into a pram much like the previous one this one you just pull out the seat it pops right through you can lower the top part as well and then you ll have a prim this one is also compatible with the Graco infant car seats so if you re not into the pram you can switch out for the car seat as well speaking differences between the two pram strollers I see a difference in the fabrics and just a little bit of the quality so I think they re both great options but I think this one is a little more stylish and this is a little bigger so your baby has a lot more room to grow in here and a lot more room to lay down that s why I kind of like this one a little bit better and next up in our lineup we have the Graco modes Nest to grow so this stroller grows with your family because it is a double stroller so it comes with toddler s seat however you can purchase a separate attachment like the infant car seat the carry cot or an additional toddler seat I ll show you how easy it is to add the infant car seat so first pop out these down below so that we can move the toddler seat so these are built-in adapters and then there are some additional adapters in the basket that we will add just like that with a couple clicks you have your double stroller that now grows with your family so the main difference between this one and our two previous strollers is this one you would start using it at six months unless you have the infant car seat attachment or the carry cot as far as the pram would this make a difference for you choosing a stroller that turns into a pram like these this would make a difference for me because I think having something that your baby can grow with all the way from the beginning especially if you re a new parent and you re not thinking about all the possible things going on I think this is such a great option to have I will say in the beginning I was really nervous about my baby sleeping in the car seat on long walks or just always being in the car seat I think the pram her lying flat would give me a little piece of mind so if you re starting your search from birth you want to start with a primet or the nest and if you have two under two or just know that you re about to have multiple kids you definitely want to start with the nest to grow so strollers have to go everywhere with you so let s see how portable how easily breakdown of all these are all right so first up we have the Graco modes premet this one is about 21 pounds it s a one-handed fold all you have to do is squeeze and push the back button and push down this is a really easy fold in a light stroller I love this fold I thought it was easy because when I m holding my baby fresh out of the stroller I want to keep her safe as I m folding and putting away the stroller so next up we have the Graco modes Nest this one is a two-handed fold you just press the side buttons and lift up and then push down the stroller ends up standing on its own which we love and I know this looks big but it s actually really light and then last but certainly not least we have the Graco modes Nest to grow this one comes in at 30 pounds to fold this one there s two buttons on the sides and the nice part about this one is it does complete the fold itself so as you can see it stands and it locks in place it s another a large one but definitely feels light when you fold it do you have one that you prefer yes the Graco Perma is by far the most compact and in my car I prefer a smaller stroller so definitely would go with the prayer mat it s also super easy just to do with one hand yeah I like the one hand but I also like how easy the nest to grow is to go down I know it s a heavier stroller it s about 30 pounds but I love the handles there and you just go down it goes really easy for a stroller being that heavy definitely something I forgot to think about when I was purchasing my stroller is how often you re going to unfold it let s go ahead and start with this unfold you re going to unlock on the side and then you need to do a little pop and then with the nest you re gonna unlock and then do a little pop-up action just like that and last but not least we have the Graco premette similar situation you re gonna unlock voila and if weight is a little bit of an issue for you I have to say that the pramet was definitely the easiest to unfold I d agree I think the permit is definitely the easiest to unfold so as for the best stroll I would have to say that I enjoyed pushing around the Prem at the most I thought it was light I thought it was easy to maneuver yeah super easy to maneuver so like if weight is an issue for you I really think that the pramed is a very good stroller as far as this one even though was a little harder to maneuver it is the heaviest and the babyless experts did say that this one has the best suspension which we agree with this one has the least bounce for baby it s because these tires are almost like jogging tires which is the only one out of these three that has tires that are that big all right and finally let s talk about what makes these strollers unique let s talk about the features and the primet that is 220 The Nest that is 320 and the nest to grow that is about three ninety dollars so all three of these toddler seats are reversible so you just click them in and then this one as well reverses case you want baby to face you and they also all three recline so these two actually have this nice little lever which offers a few more reclining options versus the primet has the strap that you can pull down so you can basically recline it halfway and then all the way but that s about it and then these two also still have the pram option where the baby lies all the way flat and they re super easy to put back facing forward just by popping it out putting it right back in very easy just like that another great feature that these two have is the slide to me feature so you are able to slide baby down further away or closer up the nice part about this feature is it even works when the toddler seat is reversed and there s three height options you can go all the way up like I am right now the middle and it clicks right into place or all the way down and speaking of things that are adjustable this one actually has an adjustable handlebar so you just press the buttons on the sides and that way if you re a little shorter or if you are taller and need the handlebar higher you can adjust that to your liking all right Kayla now let s talk about our favorite thing the basket yeah that s right all of these have a pretty great size basket which is important as parents you carry a lot of things so for the nest to grow I will say when the toddler seat is all the way down you do not have the access to the basket in the front however when you pull up the toddler seat you still do have a lot of access to the basket and also when you add the second seat you completely lose access to the front of the basket however you still got a large space back here that you have access to as well as both of these baskets are very large yeah and this basket has this really cool feature right here but that goes up and down so if you ve got a lot of stuff this can kind of protect it or if you need to have something that s longer that you need a carrier in there because these baskets are perfect for grocery runs and this stroller right here which is the least expensive of the three and it has a big basket as well and all three have cup holders which is great because not all strollers even the really expensive ones have cup holders that are already on the stroller you have to buy those separately but the premette has a cell phone holder they go above and beyond let s go and another nice feature is that not only parents can have their drinks but the kiddos can have their drinks as well and with all that being said which one of these strollers is right for you the primed is cost effective you can stroll from birth and if you re a smaller person this is a really good stroller for you because it is lightweight and easy to fold and if you re looking for a stroller with higher end features that is still affordable you can check out the Graco modes Nest this one has features like the slide to me feature that the primet doesn t have and lastly if you re looking for something that s more Luxe built to last and you re growing your family you should check out the Graco modes Nest to grow are there any other strollers that you are interested in let us know in the comments and we will do the research for you foreign Music

Baby Jogger City Tour 2 Stroller,Baby Jogger City Tour 2 Stroller Review Love Baby Jogger!,We purchased and reviewed the Baby Jogger City Tour 2 stroller along with the top 20 lightweight ...,lwGje3o5U_g,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwGje3o5U_g,25447,113,2023-06-03T12:00:36Z,we purchased the Baby Jogger City Tour 2 stroller and put it through a series of over 100 standardized tests and measurements to help you decide if it s the best fit for your family the Baby Jogger isn t a jogging stroller it s the lightest upscale stroller in the Baby Jogger lineup and it s a popular choice because of its lightweight design and especially for City Drillers and frequent Travelers and it s competitively priced we scored the strollers in these categories starting with weight and folded size the city tour 2 is a very lightweight 14 pounds its folded size is just 2.2 cubic feet it s a compact package that s convenient for storage and transportation it s worth noting that while it is small it s slightly larger than the typical airline overhead bin size requirements so do check that before traveling it scored very well in this category next parent ease of use the storage basket is small compared to some strollers but we still got a big diaper bag into it and a backpack unfortunately there are no cup holders or other storage pockets we love the grip on the rubber handle it s 38 and a half inches high similar to most other strollers but maybe low if you re tall the handle is a little loose at the fold joint there s a peekaboo window so you can keep an eye on things but we found the velcro on it to be a bit noisy the Buckle isn t bad the shoulder and hip Clips Stay Together pretty well the shoulder straps have to be re-threaded but honestly you may not need to use them except for younger kids the sea recline mechanism takes one hand to lower and two hands to raise we love how easy the brake is to use and how it feels but you have to get it all the way pressed down or it will release itself the final score needs of use next kit comfort the seat is pretty upright at 64 degrees but it is short at 16 and a half inches compared to the Bugaboo butterfly for example this stroller isn t sized for taller kids we do like the leg rest and the seat has a decent recline angle while the seat padding isn t the thickest or the thinnest it does provide some comfort but the plastic board can be felt through the padding also the sun canopy stops short of where the knees Bend and doesn t provide as much coverage as some strollers do it had an average score in ride smoothness and not the best overall kit Comfort score but now on to folding the folding is designed well and can be done with one hand however sometimes it requires some shaking it takes us an average of four seconds to fold and five seconds to unfold the part that is latched stays folded well but the other third often opens when it shouldn t it fits nicely in small spaces on a positive note it does come with a travel bag with a padded strap not terrible but not great in folding but it gets better steering maneuverability is where the city tour really shines it steers and turns responsibly on smooth surfaces and on grass rough terrain of any kind is not recommended front wheel locks keep it going straight if you aren t going to be turning much but it doesn t Veer much anyway and it s great at jumping curbs overall a great score of maneuverability what about quality well the city tour 2 is made from high quality parts and fabric as far as I can tell although the wheels could be better constructed it was average in our sideways tip over testing and tipped over backward when we hung a 12 pound bag on the handlebar we found a few potential pinch points near the hinges it s one of the quietest strollers we ve tested all in all a nice quality score the baby Jagger City Tour 2 ended up with an overall score of 70. putting it in eighth place out of the 20 strollers we ve tested here like this please like And subscribe

this video I m going to be reviewing the Baby Jogger City Tour 2 this is the first travel stroller I ever bought for my baby in 2021 and I m excited to share my thoughts and hopefully help you decide if this stroller is still a good option Music today if you re new here I m Emily I m the stroller mom I review strollers and baby gear from a mom s perspective I m a mom of three and what makes my Channel Unique is I actually use the products with my three children to provide honest reviews and hopefully help you decide so if you are not already please be sure to subscribe to my channel like this video and comment below with any questions the Baby Jogger City Tour 2 is baby joggers travel stroller and is actually been around for a little bit I believe it came out in 2020 because I remember in 2021 wanting a lightweight stroller and seeing this on my friend s Instagram and asking her what do you think should I get this I really want something that s not as big now that I had a toddler who was in a convertible car seat so it was just so much more work to take my baby out pull out my fullsize stroller and do everything and I wanted something lightweight this is the stroller I used for pretty much the first year to two years of her life and I really was happy with it I had some downside which I ll cover here in a little bit and it s interesting now after reviewing a lot of travel strollers some things that kind of stand out to me as far as features go but it served me well it was compact it was lightweight and I really liked how upright the seat was and some of those features that really worked for me there were also some downsides the biggest downside and why I actually sold it and ended up starting the stroller mom as a result is because it wasn t compatible with my car seat and when I was traveling I needed my car seat to be able to come with me and so that s ultimately why I ended up moving away from this stroller which led me to the world of travel strollers and why I have the stroller mom today so this stroller retails for 260 so it is expensive it s a lot more than I paid in 2021 and there s some things that feel a little outdated on it the handlebar overall is comfortable I love baby joggers handlebar just in general that like more rubbery feel however it s short it s definitely not the tallest you re not going to kick the wheels necessarily but it just feels like a lower it s not adjustable the canopy does not touch your hands which is good but there is no extension here you just have this this is it which is okay I honestly was okay with it when I had a toddler but with my baby I ve already noticed the sun being in her eyes this is the thing that is just I don t know it I have not reviewed a stroller with a velcro peekaboo window in a long time that wakes up your baby if they re sleeping and it is a big downside it kind of honestly feels a little outdated but I do like that it stays open when you can use the clasp there they technically you can unzipper this back part to add air flow but there s no place to store it or keep it up which I think is a little bit of a loss in regards to the seatback it is very upright it s one of the most uprights and it s pretty average it s not a tall seatback it s not a short seatback it s average it s not no rethread the buckles are okay but if I had one this is a new one I obviously bought for this review but the one I had before these wouldn t stay together this one actually does so I don t know if it was just effective or what the thing I love is how upate the seat is and that it s almost a completely full flat recline I also love that it has this foot rest and I was always very impressed with it because look at how large it is it s rounded so some parents have complained about that but I was really happy with that on naps on the go and then you do have a lower foot support here for your toddlers which I really liked as well to pull it up you re going to push these two buttons and just pull it up and it goes right to that upright position overall the stroller is really sturdy and I like that it only weighs 14.3 lb so it s definitely a lightweight option especially compared to the full size stroller I had at the time the basket can hold 15 lbs and it s honestly pretty spacious so this is not the biggest bag in the world but it fits really easily yesterday we were at a splash pad I had a giant pool bag shoved in here with pillow or with towels not pillows with towels and other things and it did really well I mean it doesn t look big but I ve honestly had very little complaints in regards to accessing the basket the brake is not the best it is not flipflop friendly it kind of hurt your foot when you do it but it s could be worse I can do it with sandals it s just not my favorite sometimes it sticks a little bit and you have to really push it down and then in regards to the wheels this my husband didn t like the stroller for this reason I it didn t always drive me crazy but it is annoying especially now that I ve tested other strollers the front wheels lock a lot I don t know if it s the closing mechanism or what the number of times that I had one wheel locked and so I m trying to like maneuver where I m going and you then have to come over here and open it it s just very annoying the other thing is is sometimes the wheels click a little bit the other biggest downside is the fold so while the fold is compact it fits in a lot of overhead bins to fold it you have this mechanism here which is fine you then have to push it over and then pull here but it doesn t always latch wow it latched that time but the number of times it doesn t latch and you have to like Pull It in together is a lot the other thing is is The Handlebar doesn t latch so if you pull the handlebar out sometimes it does that and then you have to kind of like play with it and then sometimes the front wheels don t go so actually it s gone pretty well this time I will say sometimes it does a good job but the fold was just very inconvenient the last few features I want to highlight for this stroller is the seat does hold 45 lbs and with its near flat recline it is compatible for younger babies it is also compatible with grco and Baby Jogger car seats but that s it that s where I ran into an issue the other thing that is really nice is they do sell a bumper bar and sometimes you can get the bundle on the bumper bar which is really nice and something I wish I had on this stroller but it is an additional cost so here are my final thoughts on the Baby Jogger City Tour 2 I like a lot of Baby Jogger products but this is probably not my favorite travel stroller I still think it s good for some families especially if you have a Baby Jogger or gray Co car seat I think the near flat recline and upright seat point plus a nice adjustable foot rest are huge selling points for parents and you can almost Overlook some of the other

Nuna Demi Grow Stroller,The Nuna Demi Grow is GREAT but with a few drawbacks.,,kk8EVw5bPG8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk8EVw5bPG8,468405,38107,2024-03-31T18:30:38Z,this is the Nuna demig grow and it works great as a single stroller I get soft fabric seats with harnesses I get handlebars adjustable leg rests I have storage space all underneath here if I push these buttons I can adjust my handlebars and to lock the stroller I just do this if baby wants to recline done if baby wants built- in suspension done and if baby wants to look at their handsome father done and it s easy to fold I push these two buttons pull back the triggers Fold It Forward lock it in place and that s it because it s the demig grow it grows with your family but in kind of an odd way now it s a double and if I need to put an infant c seat on the bottom I can baby b is pretty low so you get these covers over your wheels to make sure nothing splashes up on baby and these plastic pieces prevent things from going through the wheels the best part about this setup is that is super compact so it s easier to store and easy to maneuver but there s obvious drawbacks baby b gets a great view of the booty you only get storage Pace if you have the infant seat if you have the sibling seat it s all gone and the bottom baby can only face forward but if that works for you then it s great

Nuna Demi Grow Stroller,Nuna Demi Grow Double Stroller 2018 Review NEW STROLLER,"The Nuna Demi Grow has it ALL! Literally. The stroller is easy to fold, to flip the seat, and to switch to bassinet or travel system ...",WpWJLMpjpT8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpWJLMpjpT8,113773,815,2018-03-26T20:17:53Z,"We re so excited to announce that Nuna has launched a new stroller and it s been requested for quite a few years. Not only did they give us a double stroller but it s a double modular which we love. So in this video we re going to show you the ins and outs and how this stroller can grow with your family. Now it retails for 799.95 and you can purchase online at or in store. Now it s available in three different fashions. So this is the Cavier, the black, it s also available in frost, which is a nice heather gray and then also later this year in Aspen which is a heather blue. All of them are beautiful and very luxurious. You can tell by the fabrics and also by all the convenience features that it offers. So lets get into it! Now to start off i m going to go over what s included in your purchase so obviously you re going to get your frame or your stroller. Then you re going to get your all season seat. You also get two sets of car seat adapters and that s awesome because you can use the stroller with two car seats, they threw in both sets of adapters with your original purchase and then you re also going to get your weather shield which is going to go over the seat and then you have your wheel covers and that s just to keep your stroller clean and also when your child is down there it keeps their hands off the dirty wheels. So thats great! This seat packs a big punch. It has some really cool features added into it. So the seat is an all seasoned seat it has this nice thick lining that you can use during the winter and then its going to zip off to reveal this mesh seat thats great for summer. Especially at the swimming pool if your baby is wet you can put them in there, its going to drip through or dry quickly. So I love that they offer that. Now they also have this belly bar that is both removable and adjustable. So to adjust it you ll push down on the sides, just like that a pivoting and then to remove it you have this gray button on the inside and you can remove one side and let your child in or you can just remove it completely if you prefer not to use a belly bar. Then you have an adjustable leg rest. Now I do like the way that they did this. The adjust is just right here. So you ll squeeze and move it down. It s not going to be on both sides like I see most adjustable footrests. I feel like this one is a little bit easier. Now the canopy just like the other strollers in the Nuna line, you re going to have your nice large dream drape. Now you unzip it and then just pull this fabric out to expose a really long large coverage. Which is great when you re pushing your stroller into the sun. So I love that but if you don t need it, it just tucks away into the canopy. Now on the back you have your peek-a-boo window. I like that it s mesh. I dont like the plastic ones because sometimes they have glare and you can t really see your baby. It s also connected by magnets. So I prefer that over velcro just so that you don t wake up your baby when you try to take a peek at them. And then you have a nice full recline here. You just adjust that with this silver lever on the back. Now this seat is approved from birth all the way up to 50 lbs. So it does have a really high weight capacity which is great and you can start using it from day one. Now personally I would like a little bit more of a recline for my infants but Nuna does approve using it from birth. Now if you have questions that aren t addressed in this video please shoot us an email at hello babycubby.com or even comment below we would love to answer those questions for you. So that you get a better idea about what this stroller offers. Now the handle bar, I always love an adjustable handle bar especially if parents are different sizes so that s comfortable for whoever is going to push it. So this one is a telescoping adjustable. You re going to have to use two hands, you ll use your thumbs on both sides and slide it up and down. It goes up quite tall. I m 5 5 and I think most comfortable for me is probably the bottom level. I could even go up a level just fine. Now it has a really nice feel. It s a leatherette handle bar so it feels really luxurious now they also have a little piece right here which may not look like much to most people, it s a little plastic piece and that s actually when you fold it to keep your leatherette handlebar from touching the ground. So this is just going to keep it really nice longer. Now going into the wheels now the front wheels do lock and you do that just by squeezing on the sides and pulling it out and then they lock just like that. Now the benefit of locking your front wheels is to keep your stroller from jogging back and forth when you re going on different terrain. So say you re going through grass or bark it s just going to keep you going straight forward, easier, with less effort for you. Now on the back you have foam filled tires, which is great! You re going to get most of the benefits of an air filled tire but all the convenience of a rubber tire. So those are really nice you dont have to carry an air pump with you. Which is a major plus. Especially with a flat tire at Disneyland. Not fun. Now you do have a foot break right here. It s a tap on and then a lift up. Not my favorite, I dont like lifting things with my toes. However this one is pretty easy to disengage so I was able to actually do it bare foot. So it s not too bad. Now something that is different or unique about this stroller is it has adjustable suspension. So when you re on flat terrain you have these two silver adjusters here down and that s going to give you minimal suspension. Now once you twist those up as you can see you have a lot more suspension and those you would want to use again on all terrain. So on grass, bark, if you re going on a mild hike then you would flip those up so that you have a little bit more suspension so your baby is just a little bit more comfortable. Alright now how do you fold this bad boy? I can say it is really simple to engage the fold but it does have to fold in single mode so you do have to take off the second seat if you do have it and the front wheels can t be locked or otherwise the auto-lock wont engage. You can fold it, it just won t lock into place. So you fold it by pulling up on the triggers on both sides and then pull it back just like that and as you can see you have your auto lock engaged right here and it will stand when folded which is nice, you don t have to bend over and pick it up off the ground. I always love that. It also has a nice carrying handle right here. If you don t have this seat attached, you can actually pull that up over your shoulder to carry it, which is quite nice. Ok now we re going to show you how to use this stroller as a double. So you can purchase an additional seat, the second seat. One thing that I love that they did is these seats are identical. They have the exact same features, the exact same weight limits but they can go in both positions. So you don t have to keep track of which one goes in front, which one goes in back. Now it does have a really nice large basket here. In order to put your second seat on, you re just going to tuck that in to expose your adapters down here. Slide it in, click it in. Now like I mentioned because this one can recline, this one can recline as well.And that makes for a really nice sleeping position. Now this one is again is going to hold up to 50lbs. My 6 year old son even fits in there quite comfortably. He actually prefers that position. Over the top position. So you don t have to worry about being limited to the smaller child being lower. You can even put your older child up there. Now you have some other accessories or other seat options in your double mode. So to take off your seat you re just going to push up on these gray levers. Just like that and then to add on your car seat, you re going to use the included car seat adapters. Just like that and then you can click on your Nuna Pipa or your Nuna Pipa Lite. Now this we re showing you the Nuna Pipa Lite to check out those features check out other videos. Awesome car seat! Now they do include two sets of car seat adapters and that means you can put two car seats. So you connect those same adapters down at the bottom. And then another option is to purchase a bassinet. Now the bassinet is not the same one offered with the Mixx. So if you already have a bassinet for your Mixx you will have to buy a new one for your Demi Grow. But they did offer some really cool features in the new bassinet. So let me show you those! You can move the handle. You ll just push down on both sides so that it comes all the way down. So that you can have easy access. Now the mattress in here is super plush it s really nice fabric. You can also use it as a stand alone bassinet in your home so if you need a safe sleeping area while you re traveling, this is a great option. Also with the bassinet, you have your awesome dream drape that they offer in the Pipa. So these just pop out, just like that and then they tuck up. There is kind of a flap underneath here. They just kind of tuck up in there if you are not using them. And then in the back you have this flap right here that exposes a nice mesh panel. And that s just to increase air flow if it s a hot day and you need more fresh air and you can just expose it like that or fold it down like that. Now you have kind of like a foot muff. It s going to cover your baby, keep them warm. Now it has a two way zipper on here. Which I really like but it s not super convenient. So you have to align that zipper all the way up here. So once that s detached, you have to align it again. But I do like that it allows you to expose that pocket at the bottom to keep things accessible. Cell phone, toys, binkys, things that you want to keep really accessible, without having to bother your baby, but that does mean that you have to either zip it all the way up to get your baby inside or you have to unzip it completely to get your baby inside and then again align your zippers. I m not thrilled about the zippers, they are a little bit difficult to align and they are the same zippers that are going to be on your seats, and the bassinet. Now the weight capacity for the bassinet is 20 lbs, obviously you can use it to birth. So it s nice you can use it for quite awhile. Now as a reminder you can use any of these accessories in either position or both and yes you can do two bassinets if you wanted to. Now I love the versatility, you really have a ton of options for your growing family. Now some things to consider before buying. So with the second seat you are limited to just a forward facing position. However on the top seat, or the upper position. You can turn your seat rear facing. So really it just depends on the configuration and children s preferences. Now another thing. When you have someone in the second position, their feet are basically in the basket, so you do loose a lot of your storage. However depending on the size of your child, you could still fit a small diaper bag down there, with their feet. Now one thing that we hear a lot about this style of stroller is that I don t want my child in that second seat or are they even going to enjoy being down there. Now they really addressed that well by making both seats identical. So the second seat has a really high weight capacity and so it s going to fit your larger children comfortably. Also it s kind of like their cozy space. I ve really seen a lot of kids gravitate toward that second seat. One, it offers them a lot of independence. They can get in and out of the stroller by themselves. Without having to lift them up but then they kind of have this nice kind of safe haven. My kids always gravitated toward that second seat at the bottom! Now another thing that I was less then thrilled with is how you detach the belly bar. It s kind of underneath the soft goods. So it s a little bit hard to access and you can t even see it. So you just need to know it s there. Once you know it s there. It s not too difficult to engage. I do love that they made this belly bar adjustable so that you can swivel it up or down when it s in place. Now some things that we love about this stroller. I really do like that it s a one hand foot rest adjust. I don t like it when you have to push both sides and try to maneuver at the same time. I love the generous canopy. Just like this but also the addition of the dream drape. Especially on a summer day when it s super sunny you want to make sure. That your baby is going to stay shaded. That can be super annoying. I love how versatile it is. You really can customize this stroller to fit your growing family. With the car seat, with bassinets, with full size seats, which is packed full of a ton of awesome features. And then the maneuverability. I pushed it around at the park and didn t have any trouble maneuvering it over grass. So they did an awesome job on their tires and suspension to make it a convertible ride and an easy push. So this stroller retails for 799.95 and you can shop in store or online at where everything ships for free and we even price match so it doesn t have to cost you more. Now here at The Baby Cubby we want you to love your stroller! So we ve implemented a love your stroller guarantee.

Nuna Demi Grow Stroller,Nuna DEMI Grow Stroller System. 6 Month Real World Review,"Watch the unboxing video Beav does a real-world, 6-month review of his Nuna DEMI Grow stroller ...",DPGQ8qYmOos,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGQ8qYmOos,226987,2245,2021-12-08T16:41:45Z,hey what s up guys i m b from tactical baby gear and this is the long awaited uh real world review of the nuna stroller and car seat system this is the demi system we ll go through each one of these products individually now we initially did an unboxing and first impressions video about six months ago just before she was born and she just turned six months so we ve now been using this stuff for six months and we want to give you context of how we re using it what we like what we don t like and ultimately is it worth the money let me give hannah back to mom and we will start with the stroller now before i get into each one of these items individually let me give you guys some context of how we use these products uh we ve got three kids i have a 10 year old an eight-year-old and now a six-month-old so the way we use some of these products may vary from the way you use them and that i think we ll get into that more with the bassinet and the stand and some of those items and i want to try to simplify some of this information because a lot of the information on nuna s website when you start to research this stuff is very difficult to understand and very it s just not intuitive right you it s i get a lot of questions of does this car seat work with that stroller and does this the answer is i don t really know to be honest with you this is not a sponsored video this is i we bought these things because i was having a baby and i thought that it needed and warranted some information and reviews etc so that s what we re doing here i m hopeful that i can make sense of some of this stuff for you answer some of your questions and ultimately help you determine whether or not it s worth spending this much money so the car seat itself huge fan of the car seat it s absolutely fantastic this is the nuna pipa lite and just like the name implies it is very lightweight it s extremely impressive of how light it is matched with its safety capabilities and ease of use is just absolutely fantastic another thing that we like about it a lot is this additional sun shade that sort of unzips out of the main section here and pulls down over the front and there s magnets in the corners to hold that in place and then there s still mesh here for cross ventilation and whatnot so this is this is fantastic and if you need to get to the baby or give them a pacifier back or whatever this just pull that guy right up and get to it and it s easy to zip it back in place another thing that we like a lot about the car seat in terms of ease of use is how easy it is to take it on and off the stroller and put it into the car base just like that like it sits right down there it clips right in it s easy to do you just release the handle on the back of your car seat base it picks right up i mean you can see how light this is i m just kind of tossing it around the way it attaches to these items is both a pro and a con we ll get into the con in just a minute when we talk about the stroller now the car seat base i m a huge fan of as well i drive a pickup truck and i ve got guys in and out of my truck all the time so this is constantly making its way in and out of the back seat and it s so simple it s so easy it uses these brackets here to clip into the little brackets in the seat that all the modern cars have and then there is a third leg down here underneath it that folds out like this to keep it from rocking around and it keeps it nice and secure you can install that or take it out in about three seconds it s very simple i m a big fan of that okay let s talk about the stroller itself this is the nuna demi grow stroller it actually comes with the toddler seat which we ll get more into in a minute some of the pros here s the things i absolutely love about this thing and there s more pros and cons so don t worry it s super lightweight it s incredibly easy to use it s very smooth so using this thing is a breeze pushing it around the way it maneuvers and rolls around it just glides over the ground it s it s fantastic there s adjustments on the handle to raise and lower it which is nice particularly when you re walking i find myself when this is lowered like this and you re walking you tend to kick the bottom of the stroller which is annoying so with it extended you re not kicking it and it makes it a little bit nicer there is enough room up here at the top of the handle to hang diaper bags from the stroller straps so that s nice and the way that this is designed and the geometry of it it s not going to topple over unless it probably has an extreme amount of weight but even in that case the suspension this thing s got suspension in the bottom of it too i didn t mention that but you can see down at the bottom it s absorbing some of that pressure down here at the base which is really slick it s very cool then back here while we re talking about it is the foot brake you just lift it up to move it simple one touch push it down to lock it it locks in place this is another scenario where the way we use it may differ from the way you might use it down here there are some other attachment points where you can clip in a second seat and my understanding we don t use this feature because we don t have two kids that need to be in a stroller the toddler seat would clip into the top and then the car seat the baby seat would then clip into the bottom is my understanding i haven t used it yet i don t really need to use it i don t have any thoughts or opinions about it but based on how everything else works i m sure it s great the materials used on this are really nice the aluminum is really nice the plastic pieces on this are very nice pieces of plastic they don t feel like light cheap junky plastic the leather handle or vinyl handle is fantastic which also play a part into one of the cons which i ll get into in just a second even though it s lightweight it feels premium so you know how a lot of items you can tell if it s nice by the weight of it if it s it s a heavy thing it it s premium it s nicer and a lot of times things that are lightweight feel cheap and junky this is both lightweight but feels premium so i hope that makes sense it s not like a light cheap feeling thing it s a light premium feeling thing which i thought was impressive that they were able to achieve okay so the way this thing folds again it s very simple very easy very intuitive right here on the handles there s two little uh tabs i guess you would you would pull these up and this guy folds right down just like this it s super simple very easy and it folds up just like that to unfold it now there is this is actually one of my favorite parts there s a lock right here on the side so you can lock it from unfolding or you can pick it up and swing it out of the way so it never locks which i prefer oftentimes when you grab you go to disney world you re on the tram you re pulling this thing on and off and you re trying to unfold it and there s people trying to come behind you and some of the other strollers this is like permanently like this and you have to unlock it every time it s very frustrating stressful especially for my wife if you can lock this thing out of the way as soon as you pick it up it unfolds and it s it s very simple very easy very well thought through but the folding aspect is also where we start to get into some of the cons so when this is folded and you go to slide it into your vehicle and you re shoving it in there or in the back of my truck as i mentioned before i ve got a pickup truck you can see down here this is scrubbing the back of the fenders and scratching them up that leather handle is now on the ground and being pushed across and getting scraped up and then also the car seat adapter if you don t take it off is getting scraped up as you push that into the back of your suv truck whatever and it hurts my soul a little bit right this is something that you spent a lot of money on that feels very premium and then on day one you re scratching it up it feels like a miss like there s something in the engineering that could be fixed or adjusted to prevent some of these things or put an actual wear item in some locations that you know are gonna rub that are there to prevent damage on other places so that s one thing i don t like another one of the cons which is also a pro and i think that there s a balance here so bear with me i m going to try to talk this through this adapter that you have to use for the car seat is kind of a pain in the butt it works fine it s great there s nothing wrong with the way it works and functions it s just the fact that you have to use it that is annoying because here s what happens now that you know our baby s a little older and this comes with the toddler seat so brandy s got the baby in here she s taking her for a walk she s done her thing she s come back to the house she s put it in the garage a little while later oh hey we need to run to the store blah blah blah can you go throw the stroller in the car sure no problem i go get the stroller and of course this is going to be my fault as always right i m going to set that off to the side and fold this up i m going to put this in the car we re going to get to the store i m going to unfold this i m going to grab the baby out of the back seat go to put her in it and i can t because this has been left somewhere at home or in the back of my wife s car or wherever it is and now we re stuck wherever we are without the adapter and having to carry the car seat into the restaurant through the store whatever we re doing we re doing right or there s been cases where we ve had to turn around go home get it whatever it s very annoying very frustrating so you end up having to carry it thankfully this is lightweight but even with a baby in it this thing s heavy you guys carry a baby around for a long time here s a pro tip for you instead of carrying this like this the whole time and hurting your back and trying to counterbalance it with your other arm put your arm through the handle like this and grab the sort of the hub and now you ve got a nice tight grip on this thing it s tight close to your body and you re not falling over and trying to carry it you ve got a pretty solid grip on it here and it s nice and secure um so that s a pro tip for you but if they could they ve done it with their other items if they made the stroller attachment points made up with the side of the car seat the same way that we do it with our cruiser so we ve got our cruiser uh wagon stroller hybrid product that this is the car seat adapter for it that works with the nuna and it clips onto the bases at the side of the seat and doesn t require a cradle like that if nuna did that and you could clip this directly in the same way you can clip the toddler seat in just like this it d be fantastic it would eliminate that item it d be fantastic now the the potential con to that and i recognize this and i get it and it s probably a balance and something they probably struggled with internally is when you have a baby in that car seat and it s 20 pounds and you re holding it and you re trying to line up both sides and get it clipped in securely and safely is that the right way to do it either because with the adapter on here it s really easy just to set it down and it s secure it s very simple you know someone that maybe doesn t have the strength to hold the baby up and get it lined up can just plop it down on there and it s you don t have to worry about you don t have to think about it you just have to remember to bring this with you so anyways that s one of my gripes because i tend to forget this guy a lot and it causes me a lot of trouble but i will say that lining this up is very simple the way they have it engineered it s sort of a long rectangle so even if one side is lined up the other side almost always lines up directly in there no problem i ve never really had a big issue with misalignment but you could see where that problem would be if you got one side locked in and you were trying to line up this other side and now the baby isn t secured and potentially could fall etc so i m sure that was something that they weighed as a risk factor and decided to go the way they did this is the toddler seat the toddler seat comes with the stroller if i remember right i m pretty sure it does we like it as the baby s grown and gotten a little older we ve been using it more my wife s been using it more and taking her on walks etc sort of the same thing it s exactly what you think it does it does it well it s very nice it s very premium my wife said that one of her favorite features was that the leg support is adjustable and locks up because the baby s feet only come to here currently which leaves this as like an open shelf to put blankets and toys and whatever else she s walking around with the sun shade is the same thing this unzips and a sunshade extends down a little bit further blocking more sunlight and then there s a little window in the back so you can see in another nice feature is that it does it does rock back there s a tab on the back of the the toddler seat here where you can adjust uh the reclining position of it so if the baby was napping you could lay the baby back and keep keep it asleep now initially we bought this this whole set and we had a lot of questions these are questions that we asked in the first video and the first impressions that i wasn t even sure which components worked together or didn t work together so i said screw it i m gonna buy a bunch of this stuff we re gonna see what works uh and i hope that it works together because this is how i see myself using it etc and thankfully they all did work together and that was does the toddler seat fit on the base the stand right so we bought the stand this is the nuna demi grow stand that is really advertised to be used with the bassinet and that s where the confusion was well does it work with these other things and blah blah and we still their website is still like that and that s why i m trying to help answer some questions for you guys etc so the thought was can we use the the toddler seat on the stand because we could see ourselves using this quite a bit we re you know we re outdoor people we spend a lot of time outside cool we can hang outside we can cook out we can have picnics we can go to friends houses we can put the baby in this and she can be sort of part of it with us which is great it works wonderfully the stand is lightweight it folds easy it doesn t lock in this like open position which i was kind of like but realistically with the geometry of it with weight in it it s not going to fold itself over but the problem became well now we re moving inside now we re moving whatever we re going to go here can you move the baby so they ll you re like well i don t want to just pick this up and carry the baby around like this right sort of unsafe so you find yourself okay take the baby out you hold the baby i ll carry this inside or you re trying to do one of these and move it up a flight of stairs or whatever the case is so you re like well this kind of becomes a pain in the butt and not really used as often because realistically you could just put this back in the stroller and achieve the same thing so the stand in my opinion isn t a necessary item it s maybe it s a nice to have and not a need to have or if you re trying to supplement a high chair at the kitchen table by using these items together that might be a feasible thing for you it s not the way we used it it doesn t really work well for us that way so take that for what it s worth i mentioned the stand was really meant to be used with the bassinet so let s show you how that works together and i ll tell you how we ve used it this works just like you would expect it sits on there we also thought this might be nice to use the bassinet with the stain in the case that okay we re at our buddy s house we re at a party or you know whatever the baby needs to take a nap we can put her in the bassinet we could put her on the stand keep her up off the ground uh away from dogs and whatever else you know other kids you know getting in there and messing with her while the baby s trying to nap or whatever so we re like this will be great because we re we re on the move all the time we re going places we re doing things um we never did that partially probably because of covid and we all often found that when you re at a friend s house you re a get-together you re at another birthday party those people are generally you know like oh the baby can take a nap in our room or the baby can whatever right so you can usually sort of isolate the baby to a secluded area without having to use the stand and drag that into someone else s house or whatever so that was our thought of how we would use it and we never did now the bassinet we used quite a bit and we re starting to use it less and less partially because of the seasonality and the weather it s the end of november going into december so primarily we were using this on the boat and this is how we would use it we would load all of the kids stuff into the bassinet towels snacks you know all the crap you re driving around with for our older kids right brandy would carry the baby down to the boat i would carry this and drag the cooler and all the other stuff and then we would take all the stuff out of this and put this down on the seat of the boat and the baby could sleep in here while we re hanging out and cruising or doing whatever and it was great it was fantastic but she s six months old now as i mentioned she s 18 pounds she s a she s a big girl she s in almost a 90th percentile and she s starting to outgrow it already so by the time that we get back around to using this for some of our outdoor activities she s going to be too big for it she s going to be 9 10 12 months old and she ll be too big to be in this even now six months she s rolling around a lot she s picking herself up and i don t see her spending any time in this so while we love it and it does exactly what you would think it would do and it folds down and it collapses flat and it s it s a very nice piece it s got a short life for us now if you have other younger kids or you plan on having more kids this might be more worth it to you uh just to invest in this than it was for us because i feel like ah we got a few months out of it and now we re not using it and we ll pass it along to somebody or sell it secondhand or whatever the case will do with it but sort of a short life and the same with the stand so take that for what it s worth so the big question is is it worth it to buy the nuna system and my answer would be yes if it is in your budget for these items then absolutely yes particularly the stroller and the car seat are absolutely worth it the other items the stand and the bassinet are worth it if if they re going to work for you if you need those items they re very nice they re they re great items there s nothing wrong with them consider the life cycle of those items for yourself if you think you re only going to get a couple months out of it way that is it worth spending that kind of money for a short period of time so something to keep in mind if there s any other questions about the stuff that i didn t answer leave comments down below i ll do my best to answer those questions we also have another video of the unboxing and the first impressions where we talk a little bit more about these items i ll leave a link right up here i ll also put it in the description below and you can watch that video for more information i hope this was in insightful and helped you make a decision um and if it was give this video a thumbs up make sure you subscribe if you aren t already i ll see you guys in the next video peace Music you

Thule Urban Glide 2 Stroller,Running for Two Thule Urban Glide 2 Review,"Baby on board! Take your little one s there s also a double! on your run with Thule jogging strollers and accessories, now ...",AmpyuwJuXcI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmpyuwJuXcI,37710,153,2023-04-27T20:33:46Z,"Look at the turning radius on this thing. It goes backwards. Forwards. Hey, everyone, it s Ashley here with Fleet Feet. And today I m going to walk you through the Thule Urban Glide 2. It s a stroller from Thule I ve been reviewing with my son Soren, who is six months old. So just the right age to get into this stroller without a car seat. And I m going to walk you through why I absolutely love this stroller. The one thing about a running stroller, unlike some other types. Oh, look. Dirty diapers. Awesome. It folds. To me, this is pretty compact, but if you re used to a different type of stroller, you may feel like this is pretty cumbersome. The cool thing with Thule is that you can press this button and remove the wheel. So if you need more space, if you have like a lot of gear in the back of your car, you can actually take off the wheels to make this a little more low profile in the car. Okay. So we re going to take it out. I wouldn t say it s super light, but it s also not incredibly heavy. It s very easy to put together. So I have my hand on this little turning, this little section here, one fell swoop, open it up. Awesome. So now we re ready to go. This little throttle here is what you use to fold the stroller up. So you push it forward and then rotate it back. And that s how you re going to fold the stroller. This little flap covers it up, nice and cushion for the baby s legs. All right. So once you get the stroller out of your car and you get it opened, make sure that you put the brake on before you put your child or your dog or your cat into the stroller. That s very important. First of all, we have really nice grip on both sides. And I really like how this is narrower than some other strollers. So when you re running, you can still focus on your form and keep your hands in line with your body. Really easy handlebars to grab on to and the grip is really nice too. The second feature that s really great on this handlebar is this button here where you can rotate them depending on how short or how tall you are or just kind of where you want them when you re running. So you can get them all the way down here, very low, or all the way up at the highest height, we ve got them up here. Way too high for me. The third feature on the handlebars, we have this strap for you to put one of your arms through, and that s just in case you have a runaway stroller. That way you re not, you re still attached to the stroller even if you let go if something were to happen, that s a safety mechanism. Now, my absolute favorite feature of the handlebars on this stroller is the brake. The reason I love the brake, It s a single feature in the middle of the handlebars to help when you re running downhill and why this is so easy, if you think about when you re going downhill, all you have to do is pull because the brake works by pulling upwards. Moving on to the awning. So this pulls all the way forward for sun protection. And then another neat feature here, if you want to unzip this, you ll get a little bit of extra movement there so it can go down slightly lower. But the really cool thing is this added mesh paneling to help with airflow. You ll also see on the back here, let me loosen this up so you can see it better. This magnetic closure opens here for some additional mesh paneling, just more airflow if you are out on a warmer day. Moving on to the top of the awning is our second flap with magnetic closure. Again, you see that UPF 50 plus rating for all this material. You open that up for this nice skylight so you can see down in there, see your little munchkin there having snacks, enjoying the stroller ride, making sure everyone is happy. The most important thing of a stroller ride is that everyone in the stroller is happy. One of my most favorite things about Thule strollers is the interior. Like actually where your child s going to sit. And that s because all of the straps, like the closure system is really soft and the seat itself is soft. And this was an update, I believe, from one of the earlier glides is all the cushioning that you see inside the stroller. So the straps are comfortable. There s a waist belt that comes around and these will strap into here. These are also really adjustable. So you see now these straps are on the smaller setting because Soren is six months old, but they can go all the way up to the top. The stroller is rated for about six months to 4 to 5 years. So that gives you an idea about the age range that can fit inside of the Thule stroller. Alright, a couple of things you can do with this front wheel. So the first there s a dial right here that you can move in order to true the front wheel. And I think that s really helpful when you re running to ensure on those longer runs that when you re pushing the stroller forward and you re going straight, that you truly are going straight, that s going to help with reducing any side to side motion of the stroller and then just your energy output over a long distance. So super helpful feature there. The second thing is this knob that you turn to unlock and lock the front wheel. When it s unlocked, the front wheel is in swivel mode like this. When it s locked, the front wheel cannot swivel. Why would you care if your front wheel can swivel or not? If you re running faster locking that front wheel is going to help to ensure that you don t have wobble in the stroller and just to make the entire ride a lot smoother and safer. So back in underneath the stroller, this is something common with strollers, of course, is this little pull tab here. You bring in the sides and you can push this forward to raise the seat higher. So if your child wants to be in a more upright position, or you can pull this all the way back, so they re almost laying down. Back here on the back pocket, a mesh pocket for extra things, a nice little storage compartment. We also have a zip pocket here where you can slide a few things in. There s a lot of storage underneath here that you can unzip. Oh, look. You can put all kinds of things in here. It actually fits a surprising amount of gear. And I really like it because you can zip it up and Velcro it shut. So if it s raining, things stay nice and dry and things are hidden. If you re out and about and you don t want people to see what you have in your stroller. The Urban Glide 2 is one of a few strollers in the lineup and it s versatile. It s good for walking around town, it s good for running, and it does have a fair bit of suspension, which makes it also usable off road. While I wouldn t take this stroller on any type of gnarly trail, some light gravel or dirt roads are going to be just fine for this stroller. Like I said before, make sure you put the brake on."

about showing you those upgrades and a full review of the stroller i have been a runner for many years i ve run races so i am excited about showing you this running stroller which can also be used as an all-terrain stroller if you have any questions about this stroller you should email me your questions to questions.com leave a comment below give us a call we want to help you figure it out and for the ultimate experience book a free virtual consultation at mbeans.com consultations and remember the thule urban glide is available from us from magibeans with free shipping here s the review i have the updated thule urban glide 2 for 2021 um for all intents and purposes this is the same stroller as the previous model but they did update the colors so i have this really beautiful green color they also have a gray melange and a blue color as well for 20 21 on the other thing you may also notice to differentiate them is that they used to have blue touch points so for instance there s a handbrake right here that used to be blue but now it is black and the way that you sort of adjust the front wheel is also gray so it s definitely a more sleek design refined design with the new colors i think it looks absolutely fantastic now remember this is a running stroller and the reason why you want to get a running stroller for running versus an all-terrain stroller and the other stroller is that it s specifically designed for running it has a couple of interesting features that make it do that number one is that it has a has 16 inch wheels on the back the wider the wheels the easier it is to run in fact there are some running strollers out there with 21-inch wheels believe it or not they re not so popular they re not so easy to push around your cvs but they exist in the world the other thing is that there is a a swiveling front wheel which is easy to lock just by turning in this little gray lock and it um it locks out which makes the stroller nice and long so when you re running it makes it really really smooth to push there s also really awesome suspension so it s gonna make it easy for you to push and more comfortable for your baby to ride in speaking of your comfort for your baby they re these two mesh pockets on the side so you can tuck your sippy cups in the side of the different type of stroller the seat doesn t turn around so you can t have your baby facing you when it s in that sort of running position but something that s really cool about this stroller is that you can add a bassinet to it most running strollers don t have the ability to safely put your baby from newborn without an infant car seat but you can add the thule bassinet and actually use this straight away from newborn the other nice thing about the stroller it has this really nice integrated break that is just easy to use you just turn and it slows down really terrific and there s also a regular break that you can just put down by using by pushing on this little red tab on the bottom so when you are parking your stroller you don t want the stroller to roll run away so the foot brake is not for running it s for keeping the stroller stationary but the hand brake is for like slowing down your momentum when you are running there s an adjustable handlebar so if you have partners of different heights you can be in the lower position or in the three levels of let s say let s oh there s actually many levels one two three four four levels of position how do you like that um also let me show you how this folds so i m going to unswivel the front wheels and the way that you fold this down is you open up this little compartment here you pull to the right and you twist and you lift and it like folds really easy this is 25 pound stroller so it s not the lightest stroller in the world but it really does the trick if you want to make this smaller all you have to do is push on the middle of the back wheel and the wheel comes right out you can actually become really small it also makes it a lot lighter when you take off the wheel so if you re sort of like packing this into your car this is um they really thought about that in its design remember thule or thule t-h-u-l-e is that um storage racking company that you see on top of cars and so they are thinking about gear in that sort of capacity to make it really easy to use and easy to push away there s a little latch on the latch on the side to make it um unlock very very easily also another cool thing about this is that it has a zippered basket on the on the bottom so that you can put all your stuff in here and your your essentials won t won t fall out um that s important i remember i was once running a race with my family it was my wife and my brother and sister-in-law and i was the one with the running stroller and they handed me all of their gear and their stuff so it didn t like like walk away in the middle of the race so i ended up with all of their stuff and i had to throw it into the basket of the stroller so zipping it up makes it much easier so the stuff doesn t fall out it has a really great canopy with a sun visor that you can push in and push out and a peekaboo window to make sure that the baby is okay if you re doing a race or doing a long run and it also has um an extendable uh canopy a little bit of central kind of canopy for extra sun protection and also which is a uv 50 protection and again more air to flow through if you re doing long races in the summer the thule urban glad 2 is available to buy from us for magic beans with free shipping and if you want to see more videos

nice and robust and has a low center of gravity when you get the urban glide 2 out of the box the two things you need are scissors and a bike pump you need the scissors to remove all the protective packaging and you need the bike pump to inflate the rear wheels once you ve got all the packaging off you want to undo the fastening clip and then you can unfold the stroller install the wheels and you re good to go here is how to fold and unfold the urban glide 2 so first locate the big blue handle under the kid s footrest and just twist it and pull there you go it folds up in a nice package to unfold it and expand it it s just reverse you don t even need to use the handle you just pop it open so simple i m going to show you again so you just twist and pull you can do it with one hand if you ve got a baby in another arm throw the stroller in the car or whatever you re up to and then expand again later removing and installing those big rear wheels is just as easy just find the big blue button depress it and pull the wheel out same goes for putting it in push the blue button and snaps into place the urban glide 2 wraps up in a little package which should fit in almost any car boot to make it even smaller you want to remove the two big rear wheels and fold the handlebar down to the minimum setting now let s look at some of the features of the urban glide 2. let s start with the handlebar very easy to adjust you should depress the big blue buttons that s the lowest setting and back up to the highest setting the main break you ll be using while walking or running with a stroller is this big one in the middle of the handlebar super easy twist and turn super easy to keep control of the stroller while going downhills for example you ve also got this foot brake which is essentially the parking brake of the stroller anytime that you need to stop and do something hands-free use the footprint your child is kept secure with a nice five point harness super easy to undo and then do again all you have to do is insert two latches which you can do separately into the harness and there you go you ve got your canopy on the urban glade too it s pretty good it would be nice to see the kind of feet extend a few inches more to keep any low sunlight or rain totally away from baby it comes with a slightly extendable part here which is for ventilation on warm days and perhaps my favorite uh feature of the canopy is it s got a little peekaboo window here here s how you recline the chair of the urban glide 2 you simply pull on a clasp which loosens cords so the baby can recline back really it s a one-handed operation to put the seat back in the upright position you just need to do the same operation in the opposite way which is really a two-handed operation when it comes to storage you ve got a zip pocket which is handy for keys and phones and things you ve also got your cargo tray which is the biggest storage i ve seen on any stroller and there s also the mesh pocket for things like water bottles another handy feature of the urban glide 2 is this little pin which allows you to lock the front wheel in place which is handy for when you re running it stops the front wheel from pivoting around and spinning unexpectedly Music and then you ve also got the suspension system on the open clay too this is what it looks like it s pretty good last thing i wanted to mention here is the wrist strap which i always put on when i m running or maybe when i m just walking down a hill whenever you just want a little bit extra security two things to mention with it one is that to be honest i ve seen classier wrist straps this one s just a regular piece of cord and two is that it s stuck on the left hand side which isn t a big deal uh it means you can only use it on your left wrist isn t a big deal but it s nice when you can move it around and choose a different wrist so two minor quibbles with wrist strap but nothing made you complain about okay now i think it s time to take this thing out for a run i ve been running with the thule urban glide to off-road on road up and down hills and on a lot of our local trails basically handles really well it s got a nice low center of gravity the big wheels help grip the ground the handlebar feels sturdy feels like you re driving it forward brake works very well the whole thing just feels secure and safe as you re running with it you feel in control all the time Music so the bottom line is that the thule urban glide 2 is a great stroller if you re a runner and a parent if you re looking for a stroller that you can be using for an everyday stroller but also taking out on your runs whether on the road in an urban environment or off-road like where we are now then the thule urban glide 2 serves all purposes

testing many travel strollers I was not so sure I was going to like but I will say after months of using this comparing it to a lot of other strollers the jewels air plus is definitely one compact travel stroller you should be Music considering if you re new here I m Emily I m the stroller Mom I m a mom of two almost three and I review strollers car seats baby gear for moms and families and I am so excited to jump into the jewels air so one question you might be having about the jewels air plus is what is the difference between the jewes air because you see it s on discount for like 379 in a lot of places which is really nice basically what jwes did is they came in and made a bunch of small upgrades so they upgraded the materials they increased the canopy size they increased the bask size basket size a better recline so those little changes but they also got rid of the rain cover they both come with dust bags one s black and one s red the jewels the new one s black but that s it so if there re those things like having a little bit better of a recline a little bit um extend like a better extension on the canopy are not a big deal to you then you can go with the jewels air while they re still selling those but the juwels air plus definitely does have some nice upgrades including the buckles as well so that s just something to know but starting from the top I was so impressed with the quality of this stroller looking at it online and this is where like like experiencing the stroller really does make a difference I would have probably said that the jewels air was not would not be in one of my top travel compact strollers and that was because everything s modular if you want to buy a cup holder it s more money if you want to buy a bumper bar a foot rest a rain cover everything else costs additional money but the quality on this stroller and some of the features really do make it a great compact travel stroller I ve been so happy with the push the the hand Le bar the canopy is really nice it doesn t hit my hands I love how wide the canopy is which is super unique for this stroller my one beef on the canopy is it doesn t have a peek-aboo window some people call this extension a peekaboo window but you honestly cannot see your child in the sitting position with this little mesh panel here so really it s airflow which is nice but unless your child is reclined you cannot see them through this mesh panel but that is really good coverage especially if you have a child who s napping the is really nice so then you just zipper it back up that s really nice I love how tall the seat back is something a lot of parents ask me about is the upright position of the seat this is because a lot of older toddlers older babies like to be sitting upright and so many of these strollers and the competitors like the yo-yo have these terrible reclines and so this stroller well not the best it s not terrible you can see here from the fold that it does have a little bit of a recline but I will say I ve been really happy with it it does not have the widest seat but that has not been an issue and if that is a concern they do sell a really nice bumper bar that folds with your stroller that will kind of solve some of those issues with the seat depth and with the recline the buckles are so nice they kind of stick out here they have really nice high quality materials they go in super smoothly I find that I m not having to play with them a lot which I really like and to undo them you just press this one button and they come out super easily it does not come with a leg with a foot rest for the younger children but it does have one for older Toddlers and my almost 2-year-olds finally starting to be able to reach there but she hasn t needed one at this point I think the main benefit of the leg rest that you can purchase separately is when they are younger but that s something that s been really nice I love that they have car seat adapters that can fold with the stroller that is something that is so unique about the jewels air a lot of the times you have to take the cared adapters off in their entirety and that s nice if you re kind using the car seat um to get in and out of your trunk if you re living from a car Suburban lifestyle another thing I will say that I really like about this stroller is the bassinet they sell or carry cot um which is great for infants you can use that from birth you do have to take the seat off but it s pretty straightforward but that is something that is unique you only see that in the yo-yo and the jewels and the yo-yo has some downsides if you ve seen my other video so be sure to check that out if you re on the fence between these two but that is something that I really like all right into to the seat recline so like I said it does have a really nice high seat back my toddler can sleep in this stroller like if she wanted to my three-year-old could and she s tall she s like in the 998th percentile so the seatback is so so nice definitely something to consider if you are going to be using the stroller for naps on the go um in regards to the recline I will say it s not my favorite you have to unzipper it which is fine for reclining it and then there s this little strap here on one end that you can do for the various seat reclin it does have a nice mesh panel here that I really do like um for added air flow in the United States in Australia they do not have a full flat recline it s against like safety laws but a lot of other places like Europe does have almost a full flat recline in the US the only compact travel stroller I ve seen that has a full flat recline is the airgo Metro Plus which you can see my video um on that but I do think for most this is going to be sufficient and then again if you have have a newborn you can use the car seat adapters or there is the carry cot option in regards to putting it back up you just kind of pull here and then you have to tuck I don t love how the material kind of gets stuck on front of on the front of the seat so I ll show you that you can see it kind of gets stuck here and you can just tuck it back in but that s something that s not like the Bugaboo does that too so kind of is just part of it um something I love about this stroller is the basket storage so it does have an incre inreased basket size that can hold up to 11 lbs which is really nice um I find that it s it s a pretty good size and then it also has this really nice pocket here you can put your phone or your wallet this is not seen in a lot of its competitors and I really love that the brake is easy to use and is definitely flip-flop friendly I have found that the push on this stroller is really nice is it going to do amazing on Cobblestone no real compact travel stroller will but it s wellmade it s good quality it s held up it s not faced a lot of scratches and dings maybe like one but used this stroller I ve really put it to the test these past several months and I ve been really happy with that another feature I love about this stroller is the fold so you re going to press two buttons here in the handle and it is a true one-handed fold it has a really nice like stretchy carrying strap that is very comfortable and easy to use um great for travel I love that the wheels face away from me and they re not getting my clothes dirty which is something that I ve had issues with with the other travel compact strollers I ve tried and then it is compatible for almost all overhead bins which is amazing to have a stroller that has this many nice features that I genuinely like and it fits in overhead bin is really nice now if you ve seen my other videos there are downsides to doing the overhead bin when traveling especially by yourself but for a lot of parents that s a really nice feature they want to have and you can definitely do that with the stroller in regards to opening it it s really easy you re just going to press those two same buttons and then just pull up and it opens like that it is so easy one last thing I will say on the jewels Jewels all of their strollers come with a 10-year transferable warranty this is something that is not com I ve never seen it before so basically what that means is I Ed the stroller for five years and then I hand it off to my sister or a friend and the warranty follows the owner usually the warranty is only with the original purchaser so that s something that is amazing they really stand behind their products and their quality and so I hope this video was helpful in looking at the jewels air plus if you have any question be sure to comment below like And subscribe we re almost to a th000 followers we re trying to get there thanks for watching
Cybex Gazelle S Stroller,"Ultimate Cybex Gazelle S Stroller Honest Review Single, Double, Travel System that Does it All","Welcome to our in-depth review of the Cybex Gazelle S stroller! Get the stroller here In this video, we ...",zsY-pBbgPvY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsY-pBbgPvY,19742,107,2024-07-13T14:45:10Z,hey everybody welcome back to our Channel and today we re taking a look at the Cybex gazelle s stroller now this is a doit all stroller it is a single it is a double it is a travel system it s a double travel system it has a shopping basket and a shopper basket to for on the go you can use it as a pram with a bassinet you can do a double with a pram and a seat you can do two toddler seats there are 20 configurations to the gazelle so let s take a Music look so let s start with the seat the seat has a weight capacity of 50 lb it is 12 in wide with a 19in seatback and a measurement from the back of the seat to the top of the canopy of 24 in it has a padded adjustable fivepoint harness and I love how the harness adjusts it s very very easy you push the button and it allows the harness to pull out like that and then you pull the strap and that tightens it so you re going to get a perfect fit for your child no matter how big or small they are especially if you re using it with multiple children um I love that adjustment now the Buckle the Buckle is very easy to do you just push the big button and I love that there s only three pieces I ve seen other strollers that it comes apart in five pieces I feel like I m putting together a puzzle not with the gazelle s very very easy I m just going to go ahead and snap those right back in So if you re in the hurry or you know maybe you re struggling with your child this is going to be very easy to do now the baby bumper bar it is a fux leather bumper bar and it s beautiful it just looks fantastic it looks highend I love it it is a swing away and it is removable completely um so you re not going to find any foam on this stroller so I really really love the baby bumper bar now the leg and calf rest is adjustable it goes to there and then all the way up to there there are two white buttons on the side and that s going to allow you to put it down so I love that that s adjustable as well the seat is very airy there the fabric is very light it has mesh with it so it s not going to you know your child isn t going to heat up in the seat now let s talk about the recline it has a very deep recline it s very easy to do one-handed you just squeeze that it goes back to there and then all the way back to there so like I said very deep recline you could go ahead and put that up for the smaller babies now it does take it comes with cared adapter so you can use it um with a car seat as well but this is a very deep recline so I believe you can put a newborn right in the seat if you wanted and then to put the seat up you just squeeze that same lever and it goes all the way up to there that s as upright as the seat gets which is pretty upright the seat is also reversible there s two white buttons here if you haven t caught on already that everything that s white has a function on this stroller so you push the two white buttons with your thumb lift up on the seat swing it around and your child can face Music you now let s take a look at the canopy first of all it has two large panels but that s not it there s another pop out sun visor and if that s not enough all you have to do is unzip this and there is a whole other panel which I love so this goes all the way past the baby bumper bar it is full sun coverage I can assure you of that there is a peek-a-boo window up here it does not have any type of closure it just kind of lays down there s no velcro to wake your baby um and then if you want to open it you can just flip it up like that there is the mesh window I love the mesh window because it allows air to circulate through the seat as well as keep a little eye on your Rider if you don t need that extra panel you can just go ahead and zip it closed for a sleeker Music look so let s talk about the handle the handle is the same F leather as the baby bumper bar and I think it looks great I love that it s adjustable it s telescoping so it s great for taller or shorter parents alike it goes from 39 in from ground to where I place my hands all the way up to 43 so this is one of the tallest handles on a stroller on the market so I really love that for the taller parents I m the shorter parent so I like it shorter but I love the fact that it s versatile for differing Music Heights so let s talk about storage first of all you have a cup holder right here that s included you can put it on either side and it has a giant basket underneath the seat I am talking a huge diaper bag plus a ton of baby Essentials you could put probably three mediumsized diaper bags in here it is so large it s also very easy to access from either the back or the front um so really really love that plus there is an additional shopping basket so this is the additional Shopper basket that comes with the gazelle S I love it it s one of my favorite parts of the stroller so here s how you put it on I m going to go ahead and I m going to put the seat in the lower position like you would if you had it in doubles mode there s a little white button here you push that and you rotate these pieces around and that allows you to then put the seat in the lower position so it leaves room for the Shopper basket put that right there then you re going to go ahead and there s another white button here on each one slide those adapters all the way up there Take Your Shopper basket and then just slide it right in there how fun is that so now you have the Shopper basket right up here you have the huge basket underneath and you have the cup holder so there is a ton of storage on the stroller and it s just easy to just take the Shopper basket off take it shopping with you and when you don t need the Shopper basket you can just go ahead and put the seat back up where you want it you could use it as doubles mode um but I do love that it s included with this Music stroller now this gazelle s rolls on hard rubber Wheels you re not going to worry about a flat with this one they are 11 in in the back and in the front they are 8 Ines these front wheels are 360 swivel wheel for great maneuverability but they do have the ability to lock straight with this white button you flip that over and that locks them individually and then you flip it back over and that lets them swivel it has all wheel suspension so it s going to give your child also a comfortable ride I found the maneuverability is amazing with these wheels um there s also a one step break all you do is step down on the pedal it locks it into place step down again and it lets it Go Music free so let me show you how to fold the gazelle s now what you re going to do is you re going to make sure it s locked into place go ahead and lift the button that usually reclines your seat and flop it forward then you re going to take your hand you re going to squeeze this button move the other one over with the your palm your hand while also taking this one squeezing it like that it has an auto lock on the side um right over here has an auto lock right over there this is the package this is a full-size stroller so it s a decent size package um when folded to put in your Tru trunk I can get it in pretty much any sedan trunk um definitely really great you can also fold it with two seats attached I do not have the second seat to show you today um but just know that you can fold it that way and then unfolding it just go ahead and undo that auto lock lift up on your handlebar lift up on your seat put everything back in position and that s pretty much it so very easy to unfold there s a couple steps to the fold but it s not hard and once you get the hang of flipping the seat forward and doing the little white buttons it s no problem at Music all now remember at the beginning when I told you about the amazing versatility with 20 different configurations well they start you out with a pair of the car seat adapters these work with a sidebags um car seat which is sold separately um but let me just show you how you can turn it into a travel system go ahead and remove your seat then these car seat adapters can either go on the top adapters or the bottom adapters let me just talk about really quick that I love the fact that they have integrated adapters on it so when you want to turn it into a double you re not buying additional adapters which is fantastic you do have to get an additional seat or maybe the car seat but I love the fact that the adapters are already built right into the frame so you go ahead and you put your car seat adapters figure out which one is which side like that you just snap those into place take your this is the Cybex you snap it in there and you have yourself a travel system like I said it also works a double travel system if you do get a second set of car seat adapters you can put two car seats on the frame you can also put the toddler seat or the baby seat on the bottom with the car seat you can move it around like I said it can go with the carry cot the sideb carry cutt you can do two seats the seats can face each other they can face out real a lot of Versatility let me just tell you a ton of Versatility with this stroller and I love that because right when you re having a baby you want a single right and this one becomes a beautiful single right out of the box it even has that Shopper basket but then let s say you have baby number two you don t want to scrap your stroller right you love your stroller this one becomes a double and then when your older child outgrows the stroller you can go right back to the single so like I said super versatility on this one now the Cybex gazelle comes with a rain cover it comes with the cup holder and it comes with that Shopper basket there are also all types of accessories sold separately that work with the stroller so you want to check those out the stroller also comes in multiple colors so you can pick the one that suits your family and your lifestyle I love it I really do I think there s some fantastic features about it um I love the the harness and how it adjusts so easy I love that the seat is reverse I love the look of the stroller and I love that it has this beautiful faux leather I love the really tall handlebar and the huge basket underneath the seat as well as the additional Shopper basket it is a really good push it s easy to maneuver it has 20 configurations guys I mean you can t get more than that right it even in includes one of the configurations as a double travel system that s hard to find when you have twins um so I like it I think I there isn t really any complaints about it as a matter of fact um I think it s fantastic so check it out I will leave a link in the description below for you to check it out to see if maybe the stroller is the right one for your family um so that s it thanks so much for watching and I will see you in the next video bye guys Music

Cybex Gazelle S Stroller,"Cybex Gazelle S, An Impartial Review Mechanics, Comfort, Use","In order to keep our recommendations up to date, we maintain a Buyer s Guide with a wide spectrum of models, and a lot of ...",0Rv7f9fhNSM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rv7f9fhNSM,52761,399,2020-11-23T13:56:11Z,today we re going to be looking at the gazelle a new multifunctional tandem model from cybex this is an interesting model for several reasons from a customer perspective because it s a presumably premium two-child model priced a bit below other top end two child models and also because of its shopping configuration where the bulk of the model becomes dedicated to holding your stash and as such becomes a potentially cheaper alternative to the boogaboo donkey from a mechanical perspective we find it additionally interesting because this is cybex s first foray into building models with these proportions meaning bigger and necessarily sturdier in order to deal with the increased weight capacity and it s interesting to see the route they ve taken to pull this off especially since the gazelle is a gold line model a designation tied to cybex s self-imposed product hierarchy which implies that the quality is a tad below that of its platinum line in accordance with its lower price so let s get started then beginning with some stats the gazelle clocks in at 12 and a half kilos and folds down to 56 by 32 by 74.5 centimeters in its most compact configuration it can take 22.6 kilos of weight per seat which is far more capacity than you will need given the size of the seats and storage wise can load 10 kilos in the upper basket when in shopping mode and 13 kilos in the underslung basket note that when considering the folded size and overall weight of the model you of course do need to add a little bit if using gazelle in its tandem configuration starting off with a seat i would say that this is where the gold line placing of the model strikes hardest in the gazelle s somewhat cheaper textiles with minimal padding and a canopy that though it does provide sufficient sun protection is primarily single layered and a bit weaker in its mechanical elements the night of light in addition size-wise the gazelle seat is a bit shorter than one would find on an average midsize model and i would say that though they claim the model is suitable for children up to four years old the actual age limit for full comfort is closer to three years old depending on the size of the child note though that when using the model for two children both seats are the same size which is a characteristic that separates out the gazelle from a lot of other tandem models which tend to provide a primary seat of standard mid-size proportions while the tandem seat is smaller in terms of use then this makes the gazelle somewhat subpar as a single child model but above average size-wise at least if using the model for a pair of children with a tight age span when it comes to parent comfort and overall ease of use the gazelle has both pluses and minuses as far as the handle is concerned the model offers a good range of lengths and is sturdily built feeling quite solid in your hands while pushing around the stroller s significant bulk the gazelle is also relatively easy to fold though there are more steps and mechanisms involved than one finds with most cybex models due to an additional safety trigger on the handle and the potential need to fold multiple seats or remove the shopping basket depending on how you are using it though we ll be discussing the gazelle s mechanics in more depth in a moment it s worth noting here that the overall structure of the model has a very solid and reinforced core with good suspension but that most of the peripheral peripheral elements attached to this core the seat sliding adapters and the rear wheels are all a bit loose right out of the box which makes the model feel a tad rickety with regard to these elements and can make some functions a bit fiddly to use in addition despite the good suspension and decently sized wheels the chassis is quite long back to front which makes maneuvering somewhat cumbersome and makes tipping the model backwards as one needs to do for example when going up a curb very heavy to accomplish this second problem is exacerbated when placing a child in the lower forward position due to the distribution of weight and the result of this is a serious limiting of the gazelle s driving ability when using either the shopping or two-child modes and even when using the gazelle as a one-child model in the basic configuration the effects of that length on maneuvering and the extra force needed to raise the front end keep the gazelle from living up to the full potential that a sturdy core suspension and decent wheel size would otherwise afford in my opinion further concern about that lower front position when forward facing as would be necessary to get the most out of shopping mode for example is how far away you are from your child as well as how low to the ground your child is which to my mind is a bit sketchy to start with but additionally means that you have to stop any time you need to attend to your child and also frankly a lot of children just don t like such separation it can be scary to them which is one of the reasons for the popularity of reversible seats so unless you re pretty confident that you know your toddler s opinions on such things you should be careful not to purchase the model just because you prematurely picture yourself strutting carelessly about with that mostly shopping cart stroller configuration okay let s move on to the mechanics of the gazelle then starting off with the handle the fold and the overall structure as i said in the last section the core design of the gazelle is quite solid though let s be honest for a moment and point out the pink elephant in the room that solid structure is not hard to achieve when one is blatantly ripping off a model as tough as the upper baby vista all across the gazelle s chassis from the telescopic handle down to the simple folding system from the vista style suspension to the reinforced hinges and riveting the gazelle has been built in proportions and with a respect for structural integrity that has otherwise not appeared so far out of cybex as a brand other than on their astronomically priced platinum models this very much includes horizontal symmetry by the way achieved via the handle the thick welded rear crossbar and the solid front frame all of which in addition to the seats shopping basket and so on which just add horizontal support make the potential for asymmetry issues very unlikely with the model in the end then there are only two larger structural concerns that i have with the gazelle the first being the slamming motion needed to achieve the fold which has the potential to accelerate wear on the internal components and the second having to do with the potential pressures of the model s length for users focusing on the front loaded configuration but in the second instance given the simplicity of the fold and the general horizontal support i doubt that much will occur to the main body of the chassis other than a bit of looseness in the middle hinged areas moving down then to have a closer look at the rear frame i ve already mentioned the good suspension and sturdy crossbar but i d still like to make a few notes on the brake system and the rear wheels regarding the brake system i ve got to say that this is where they should have quit copying the vista at least from a longevity standpoint as the rotation based system they usually employ is actually a tad simpler and in many ways less prone to problems instead they ve often opted for a ballpoint style flip-flop friendly break with a wire to get from side to side mechanically then this more complex system creates a greater potential for problems both due to the wire which doesn t have an adjustment screw to control tension problems commonly occurring in wire based systems over time as well as within the housings themselves which necessarily make use of a number of small spring loaded components an another area on the rear frame to be aware of is the way the wheels connect to the chassis in that one side of the axle is flat as it enters the housing meaning that the axles do not spin within the housings at all but rather only spin within the ball bearings on the wheels themselves this is generally a good thing as it better protects the chassis from wear though given a certain looseness in the wheels right out of the box i d guess that there s a potential for ball bearing issues down the line and thus since the axles do not spin within the housings it will be important to remove the wheels from time to time and lubricate the connections to prevent brust buildup so that should there be problems in the future it will be possible to remove the wheels for replacement or repair moving on to the front frame lastly the first thing i d point out is the size of the front wheels as well as the decent suspension on the front forks as i alluded to earlier this setup combined with the gazelle s average 12-inch rear wheels and a good rear frame suspension would have made for a decent degree of terrain capability had these characteristics not been thwarted by the effects that the overall length and configurations aimed at front loading the model have on maneuverability on the one hand and the ability to tip the stroller backwards to get up and over curbs on the other that being said provided that you use the gazelle in a relatively flat environment these elements will definitely still help with certain aspects of terrain such as cobblestones gravel and snow and so on where the train-like bulk of the model will aid in plowing over or through such impediments looking closer at the front frame the front wheels are quite tight in their housings which is a nice thing with an o-ring style rubber washer at the base of the axle providing a bit of pressure the main reason they are so tight however is that the axle sits flush through a ball bearing before being locked in the housing higher up the positive side of this design in addition to the tightness of that connection is a smooth rotation of the bearings but it s important to note that anytime you use bearings in this way there is the potential for wear down the road which may result in the need to replace those bearings though this is neither difficult nor costly mind you in addition as with the rear wheels it s important to lubricate inside this mechanism regularly not only to keep the bearings running smoothly but also to keep the axles from rusting to the bearings which would make fixing any sort of eventual problems a nightmare as a last note on the front frame though there is a pretty standard swivel lock that overall chassis length and front loaded weight do make the model nearly impossible to tilt for turning if one were to lock the wheels which makes the swivel locks more or less useless other than in the one child mode with the middle seating position so would i recommend buying the cybex gazelle s then my judgment of the model is as follows from a mechanical standpoint the core design of the model is generally strong and though there are a few weaker elements as i ve pointed out i would say that longevity wise this is a good model for its price the real problem with the gazelle however comes down to use value and i d like to explain this by making reference to a couple of other two child models that to me the gazelle seems specifically designed to undercut price wise the upper baby vista and the boogaboo donkey if you think about the gazelle for a moment there are three potential configurations single child not for shopping with a seat in the middle position single child in the shopping configuration and the two-child configuration in the first configuration the use value of the of the gazelle as a cadillac type model versus the vista for example though many tandem strollers are built this way is degraded by not having a larger sized and more luxurious basic seat as well as by the effects of the chassis length on the model s terrain capabilities in the second configuration single child shopping mode the gazelle fails to compete with the bugaboo donkey whose mono configuration has made it one of the best shopping strollers for years both because the donkey gives one easy and direct access to their child as well as because its wide footprint provides significantly better maneuverability and terrain capability than the long front loaded design of the gazelle in the end then in terms of best use the gazelle really only offers value in its two-child mode where the price and equality of seat size may give it an advantage with specific though not all age spans between siblings provided one lives in a very flat urban environment with a lot of access ramps in any case we hope you found this video interesting and if you did we ask that you subscribe as it helps us to continue making videos in the future in addition

for the day you simply just pull it off and you are good to go so you don t need the basket anymore now one thing that is also very unique about the Cybex gazelle s2023 is that you re going to have these gliders up at the top that you can move up and down depending on your configuration so not only in your manual are you going to see this but actually at the bottom of your stroller there are all of these different configurations you can create 20 or more configurations with the carry cot with the additional seat with a car seat and down here you will see all of those configurations and where your glider needs to be so I m going to move mine down to the first position there are three positions and I m going to bring this toddler seat up and now we are in mono mode or single mode so this is what the stroller looks like just as a single with that one toddler seat really really nice here now let s talk about the seat you have a really nice almost true flat recline and you can utilize this

carry cot but you can also put your favorite car seat on top with added adapters so amazing to make that travel system or you can use the carry cot which I will show you now so again I m going to take the toddler seat and have it parent facing and then I m going to put it on the third level here so again you can always refer to your stroller manual or even just the bottom of the basket to see what level you need to be on so I m on the third level and then I can just pop that carry cut on and you are good to go in double mode from birth the carry cot is also a great added accessory you have a really nice little sun shade that can pop out here great material it is super cozy for baby I wish you guys could feel the mattress it s like a memory foam it is so soft and so great for baby so

Thule Sleek Stroller,Best Strollers For Twins Why We Went With With The Thule Sleek Stroller How It Works,"A question we often get asked is What stroller did we decide to go with?! There are so many awesome strollers out there, but ...",-0fmWWAEH5k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0fmWWAEH5k,102048,984,2020-04-18T20:00:00Z,we get asked all the time what stroller we decided to go with birth twins and it was kind of it was an adventure for us to decide ourselves there s lots of great options for strollers for twins we did a lot of research before because we knew that we wanted to get more of a high-end stroller one that would last us through all of our kids and so it was really important for us to have something that would be durable and something that we could transition as we have more kids and things like that and also with twins you have a little bit of a difference with other strollers is you need something that can support the similar weight of both children as they grow yeah pisum strollers they are made for a bigger child and a smaller child yeah and not two of the same size but we actually went and tested a bunch of strollers out and while we were there the owner of the store was a twin mom and it was a big sell day and she happened to have four other friends that were there that had twins as well and we talked to them all and every single one of them had a different stroller and for different reasons a couple options for twin strollers is there s the Bugaboo Donkey that one is a side by side stroller which we ve heard is great except for sometimes if you have with car seats you can t go with the car seat attachments on it you can t get through a door on it but without the car seat attachments you can t get through a door on it and to use double doors or things or take them off so we don t want to mess with that another option is the city select stroller we had a couple friends who had leased that but we had one friend who had trouble getting their stroller open and closed but I heard really great things about that stroller ultimately we were deciding between three strollers they were the UPPAbaby Vista the Thule sleek and the third one was the nuna demi grow and the reason why we re leaning especially towards a nuna is because we knew right off the bat especially with twins that we wanted to get - car seats around and so this is the the nuna Pippa Lite is a ppl Pippa I don t know I call it pip pip alight and I mean these things are so light we just knew we re gonna be carrying at times - one in each arm we knew that we needed to have a stroller that could adapt a baby Nina and the Thule could all add add up little adapters to the nuna car seat and a couple things that we were looking for sides like durable and transitioning with our family is it needed to be Disneyland approved that was really big for us yes sir so it couldn t be too big so you can take it in to Disney uh-huh and it also needed to be have a big enough little cargo space to be able to put our diaper bag and any extra goodies but we also wanted it sleek and like calm you travel with because we knew with twins needed to be able to have our hands accessible and after like talking to my sister and stuff she was like you should just bring your stroller everywhere you should bring it with you to church you should bring it with you to restaurants you should bring it with you while they re still little so you can have them strapped in have your hands-free and so we needed something that could easily move around really quickly and that wouldn t take up too much space but be able to work for our needs ultimately we decided to go with the Thule sleek and it really is sleek it is it s such an awesome stroller I had a friend who had this stroller and that s actually why we looked into it and we loved it it s been awesome so we re gonna show you how it works we re gonna take it outside show you how we switch it from the car seats to the bassinet to the chairs the little upright chairs and all of that it s gonna be fun it s closing it right now to show you how we open and close it it s nice the wheels come off roll easily like this so if you need to take it apart you re like yeah it doesn t fit these are adapters on it and I just double it up yeah because normally you don t have to have them but since we have two babies yes and normally just has the one yeah so we have a second set of adapters when I put this in the back of the car I leave all the adapters on so easy for me to be by myself and pull it in and out I leave the handle out I leave everything ready to roll these are the little car seat adapters that go on these work with the nuna car seat and it s great they just pop right on and then we just pop both of the car seats on and go in just right on the sides and that s in the reason we wanted to go with the Thule is because the girls aren t completely stacked ik on top of each other you have an errand the nuna was really compact but they were like opposite direction and like stacked like and really tight so I felt like this was roomy enough but didn t take up so much space either yeah this is it with the car seats on it and the great thing is - the buttons still work on it so if you need to push this down you can easily push that down when we re at church I ll just if I need to pull a girl out I can pull them out if we need to walk around we can do that too and the great thing is even with the girls in it you can easily push with one hand I go on walks all the time with the girls and with Zeke in one hand and he needs one hand for himself but when we go for walks we actually use the bassinet we had just ordered these and they are super cool and they are so soft and cozy I ll show you how we take these off and then we ll change those out so it s really easy you just pull those off and then those adapters come off that are for the car seat pop those these are really awesome because Rose will fall asleep in here and the great thing is when they re done I can easily just click this button and I pulls right out and I can just let them continue to sleep in here and here s the second one when there s double bassinets the girls are stacked on top of each other more than they normally would be so normally we would have Scout down here DD up here however scout was more of a kicker and so she got goes on the table easily swapped oh yeah but the great thing is there s tons of space she s not claustrophobic down there we will leave this up but you can easily put the cover down we just leave it for Sun purposes but these just snap on they can easily take that on and off but it s super cozy down there and then here s the full set up I know every time we take the girls on walks in this I m always like oh I wish I could be inside I know I want my own cozy pod and then these have a Sun Shade and these bassinets also came with a rain cover that goes over them so it has a clear cover on the top which I like and it wraps around the entire raft the net access to binky s which is really nice so they have a little breathable area and like this even has mesh on it the thing I really love about tule is I feel like they really were thoughtful with everything like all the fabric is UPF 50 plus it has little sun shades that pop out inserts inside unzip if you need to clean it these bascinets actually collapse so you can store them so I feel like there s a lot of things that they really just were thoughtful about and the design of this stroller this is how we did our configuration when we went to Disneyland it was so awesome because there s nowhere to set down your baby it was the best thing ever having these suppose we have two more like you got that one down while you re holding orders especially if we did like writer switch or anything like that we want to show you the storage compartment it s the UPPAbaby Vista had a bigger storage compartment slightly but this one I honestly feel like it s a perfect size it zips it velcros this is the fawn diaper bag and it is ginormous it s seriously a huge diaper bag and the nice thing is there s still room on this sides first big and small but I honestly just leave it in there and if you put the diaper bag with it facing out you can just unzip it and easily grab stuff alright Jake s gonna show us how to collapse these minute collapses down then you can just have all your stroller parts and a big bin where you can give your big-girl chairs yeah the first time these two have tried I think so yeah living the life right here Enki a toy I Music Applause think so Applause no matter what the road pavement would be to Lee is like an adventure Brad yeah there s what do you think girls ready to adventure it s really nice is you can move this from either side to get them in and out so this is really cool - seatbelts or a five-point harness and it has this strap on the side so it holds them really secure and snug especially when they re little because our girls are almost 15 pounds now so they re still little we wanted to point out - on these chairs the five-point harness and you can move these to adjust to your baby s high want to show you this is how I leave it with the attachments on for the car seat and I just put it on and I just leave it like that and I shut my car but I wanted to show you guys how when it s just me with the girl how we do it so I just pull it out it s awesome hop start out put the brake on so then I grab one girl the attachment and I also keep my diaper bag in the back so then I can just put it in the car too ready to go that s a wrap on our tule sleek and why we ended up picking that stroller for our twins thanks getting a drink of water right now but we seriously love it and feel like it works for our adventure lifestyle and on the go and being able to have something that s like easy and we have loved it we ve taken it to Disneyland and we ve taken it on different trips and it has been awesome champ that s know if you have any questions or tell us about your favorite stroller in the comments below yeah I m curious to hear there s lots of great ones out there but this is why we went with the Thule sleek and we have loved it and so we thought we needed to share thanks so much for watching see ya
Thule Sleek Stroller,THULE SLEEK REVIEW Single-to-Double All Terrain Stroller,USA Links Thule Sleek Stroller - Nuna Pipa Lite Car Seat ...,rtH26gav6sY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtH26gav6sY,29163,445,2021-05-03T14:00:17Z,hey guys welcome back to embers and ash my name is ashley if you didn t know and today i m going to talk to you guys all about my thule sleek stroller i ve known that i wanted to make a review on this stroller since i got it but i obviously wanted to use it for a while before i talked about it i ve been using it for nine months now my son is nine months old so i feel like i have a pretty good idea about what i like what i don t like about it and also when i was looking into getting this stroller there weren t that many reviews from personal experience that i could watch on youtube anyways so i wanted to put this out there for anyone who s interested hopefully i will cover everything and you ll have a good idea of whether this is a good stroller for you or not so yeah let s get into it we will start with just an overview of the whole stroller the main reason why i picked this was because i wanted a stroller that was all terrain or as all terrain as a stroller can get but i wanted to be able to go through grass gravel sand all the trains and not feel like my stroller was falling apart or was too bumpy and the thule sleek caught my eye because it has four point suspension not something you typically hear about a stroller i m pretty sure it s the only stroller with four point suspension i could be wrong so that four point suspension allows you to have a smoother ride on those uneven grounds so i immediately knew this was probably the one i was gonna get the other reason why i was drawn to this one was because i wanted a double stroller or a stroller that converted into a double stroller i only have one kid but i didn t want to buy two strollers like a single stroller for my first kit and then a double stroller for my second kid i wanted to just make one investment and pick a stroller that grew with my family so that s why i got it now let s break down the components and the configurations when you buy the stroller it comes with this single seat it s not rated for newborns i can t remember the exact age range of it but i will post it on the screen so that you know it comes right off by pressing the buttons here i ll get more into the seat in a second but i want to start with the frame to adjust the handles you flip down these two latches on either side and then the bar will go in or out the break is at the bottom here i really like that it s activated with your foot i know some strollers have the brakes on the handle here you can see the suspension that allows a good amount of give and like i said it s also in the front wheels and then one of the parts that i was most excited about was this basket what i like about it is that it has a cover that you can open up and just drop inside and that gives you the option of having an open basket or a closed basket i really like being able to close it because you can store things in there and still fold it and put it in your car without having to always empty it out or if you just want to hide belongings while you re at the beach etc it s just nice having that option the other thing i really love about it is that it actually expands there s just some magnets holding this flap back here and the basket grows to a very decent size this way you can get a better view of the size of the basket from this angle it really is the perfect size for me i can do a full grocery shop in this basket with no worries about space so if basket size is a concern for you i think this one really does cover it the other thing i forgot to mention is how big the wheels are that also really helps with a smoother ride they aren t um air inflated but i actually like that better because you don t have to worry about having a flat tire um the air inflated strollers i m pretty sure do run smoother but i prefer this to collapse the stroller you don t have to but i like putting the handlebar in and then there s these two latches on either side that you pull up and you push the handles down and it collapses this is the collapsed form it s not the smallest stroller or the lightest roller you ll ever use but it s very sturdy and durable which is something i much prefer over lightweight and small if you do have the handle extended a little bit it does allow the stroller to stand up on its own and there s a piece of plastic along this leather handle that protects it from the ground and then to open it back up it s the same thing you pull those levers and you lift okay now let s talk seats so like i said the seat that comes with the stroller doesn t work for a newborn so you have to get a separate car seat with car seat adapters tule doesn t make its own car seat that clips right onto this so you have to get adapters the car seat that i chose is the nuna pipa lite um you don t have to get this one there s a couple options but i wanted this one because it s one of the lightest car seats on the market these are the adapters for the car seat they just click on here and just like that so this is the main way that i use the stroller right now like i said my son is nine months old so he s in this car seat a lot and it just makes for an easy transfer and then if you re interested to take the car seat off it has two latches on the side and you lift like that okay now we will get back to the seat that comes with the stroller it just clips in like this wonderful the hood just pulls down i like how big it is you can also extend it further by opening up this zipper and under that zipper is actually a mesh lining so you can get more airflow during the summer while still protecting their face from the sun or if you don t want that airflow you can just cover it up and still get the extension there s also this peekaboo window it s nice that it s a magnet so you re not ripping velcro i know that s a concern because if your child s sleeping you don t want to be ripping velcro and waking them up so i really do like the magnet feature and that s just the little window there if this wasn t enough coverage for you it also has this little visor that pulls out i ll push this back so you can see better little visor here that pulls out basically the stroller is going to let you protect your child from the sun you can also adjust it up or down based on your child s height which is nice so for the inside of the seat there s a bar here that you can remove either from one side or either side you can completely remove it there is a five point harness here which isn t my favorite design these side ones don t actually clip in they just slide in and then you need the top one to secure it so you can t just do a lap belt you have to use this top one if i m being completely honest i ve definitely just used the top before um it s just a lot of work to do the side straps every time if we re doing an easy train you know and then the last part is this foot rest you press the buttons on either side and it goes down or up um pretty straightforward something i forgot to mention is that you can buy a cup holder attachment which i obviously wanted to use it you just have to pull the handlebar up and it just snaps onto the side uh it works it s nice it s not great for anything heavy it s honestly best for single use products like a single use coffee cup or single-use water bottle it s just not rated for a lot of weight um but i still get a lot of use out of it and it s worked for me okay moving on let s talk about the bassinet so the bassinet also just snaps on the same way very straightforward the bassinet does come separate i didn t get it right away but after a couple months with a newborn i ended up wanting it just because my baby in particular didn t like staying asleep in the car seat on the stroller while we were walking he would be asleep but if we ever stopped he would wake up so i got this and it helped a lot because he would stay asleep while he was laying down so it comes with this cover here that has a magnetized flap that helps protect your baby from the cold or the sun whatever so that s nice it just snaps on and off and then just like the proper seat it has this little visor that you can fold in or out to remove it from the stroller it s just a single button up here and then there s two buttons on the inside to lower the visor my issue with this is that the buttons can get a little sticky and you have to make sure that the bar is fully pulled towards you to be able to actually put it down just like that as for inside the bassinet it s this really nice white quilted material white is definitely not the best option but the lining is all removable so you can wash it which i have done before and then the last few things about the bassinet i want to mention is just how storage friendly it is it actually collapses down which helps a lot when you live in a small space like me it s definitely still big but it s better than if it was just this size so to collapse it you just put the canopy down and then these bars that attach it to the stroller you need to actually press this button and move them upwards this button is kind of hard to press but it s not the biggest deal because it s not like you re pushing it up all the time it s just for storage you do it on both sides then you remove the mattress and there s two bars in here that you pull towards each other and then it s just folded like that and i store the mattress kind of inside on top kind of thing um like i said it s still not tiny but it s better than it was and then one more feature that i wanted to add is that it has this opening for ventilation right where your baby s head is and that s nice for breathing purposes obviously and i m not sure if you can see but there s some actual holes in the mattress which again help with the ventilation okay so now let s talk about turning it into a double stroller like i said i only have one child so i haven t used it as a double stroller yet but i ll show you what i can so when i bought the bassinet it came with the attachments to turn it into a double i don t have the second like proper seat for it that s something i would get with my second child but you can still do a lot of configurations with the car seat the bassinet and the original seat so on the top connectors here you add these guys and then there s these claspy ones for the bottom i m not going to show you all the configurations there s a lot of them i ll put a picture on the screen something you should know is that the seat that comes with the stroller does not attach onto the bottom that can just be a little annoying in case you wanted to get around buying the second seat um and having a proper seat down here but i don t know maybe i ll choose to not buy that second seat it really will depend on how things go once i have a second baby um yeah okay let s let s set it up a couple times gotta add my cup holder this is one configuration with the bassinet on the bottom what i like about this is that your toddler is up top which i assume they need more attention than a newborn so it kind of makes sense to have the baby down below what i don t like is how long this gets it s a fairly skinny stroller which is really nice um but that length i know would probably get a little annoying but you re also not always using the bassinet so we ll switch it out for the car seat again you need these adapters i feel like this is a really practical setup i would use this one a lot the only thing is yeah your newborn doesn t need as much attention but you kind of want to always look at your newborn you know so i m sure i would always be peeking over trying to get a look but we don t have to settle on this one like i said i don t have the seat for this but if you got that second seat it could sit down here just like that and i think that s also a really nice setup something i really like is that you always have access to the basket i know some strollers the seat goes very much into that basket and then you lose access to it so i like that i can still use the basket and then also when the children are a bit older and they both need this type of seat i ll have two if you have twins you can also set it up this way that s pretty cute i mean i don t know why you wouldn t just do both car seats if you have twins but you can do it oh something else that i forgot the seat that it comes with and the bassinet both come with rain covers which is really nice like most the time the reason i m using this seat instead of the car seat is because it s raining out and i need the rain cover something else that i completely forgot to mention is that the seat does recline which is really nice because a lot of the times we re on a walk and my baby gets tired and they want to take a nap so all you do is pull the back here and it can go completely flat and then you can extend this open further for more sunshade so i do really like that feature you can also put it at a 45 degree angle which is nice when your baby is kind of transitioning out of the car seat into this and they don t want to be full upright yeah what else is there you can obviously also switch this around to face the other direction a couple other things that i don t own one is a snack and drink tray for this seat you take that front bar off and you attach a little tray for your toddler that s nice they also have a gliding board for the back here that kind of clips onto that back bar and a toddler can stand on there which is really nice because if you have three young kids you can have one in the car seat one in this regular seat and one standing on the back and you re not in this huge bulky stroller it s still fairly compact oh something else sorry now i m just like thinking of a bunch of random things that i haven t mentioned you can actually lock the front wheels by just pressing these buttons up here and then they will lock in place that is really nice for gravel sand anything that s kind of hard to go through locking the wheels helps a lot and i really like that the buttons are on the top because i know some strollers have the buttons on the side of the wheel and it s just a lot dirtier to press that versus up top here okay i m pretty sure that s everything i wanted to cover if you have any more questions please comment them i will get back to you as soon as i can um yeah overall i really love this stroller the off-road capabilities is really nice it s not perfect but it s a lot better than some of the other styles of strollers any of the little negatives i ve talked about like just sticky buttons that kind of thing not that big of a deal you re never going to find a perfect stroller and i am very very happy with this purchase it also just looks beautiful it s very sleek as the name says i m nine months in and i m planning on using this for all my children in the future thank you guys so much for watching i really hope you enjoyed this video and learned everything you needed to learn about the thule sleek stroller thank you so much for watching and i ll catch you in the next one

lot of ...",o_vTkdn4-z8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_vTkdn4-z8,79173,273,2021-01-10T19:56:42Z,today we re going to be looking at the cybex lebel the semi new ultracompact from cybex i say semi because despite the fact that there are a few legitimate differences the label is quite clearly built off the gb pocket design which is owned by the parent company good baby international not that this sort of rebranding is a new thing for good baby mind you cybex is only one of over a dozen fronts through which a company rebrands the same designs in order to create a sense of originality and brand uniqueness but this review isn t going to be about all that however we have an article that covers the relationship between cybex and goodbaby international on our patreon page if you re interested and it s not going to be about the gb pocket so much either rather in this video we re going to be focusing in on the label itself having a look at the model in terms of how comfortable it is for children and parents alike its mechanical attributes and with regards to what roles it fulfills in comparison to the larger market so let s get started then beginning with some stats the lebel clocks in at 5.9 kilos and falls down to 32 by 20 by 48 centimeters cybex claims it can carry up to 22 kilos in the seat which as i will explain in a moment is highly optimistic on their part when considering real-world conditions and can take roughly three to four kilos in the underslung shopping basket as far as the seat is concerned it s worth pointing out right from the offset that this is a very trimmed down bare bones sort of stroller its targeted use is very specifically oriented on travel or day trip use and its primary selling points are to be cheap and small and the result of this design direction is that they have cut a few corners size wise the label seat is actually quite middle of the road for ultracompacts though in my mind a couple of factors effectively limit the model s optimum use to roughly six months to a year and a half on the younger end because the model doesn t have anywhere near to a full recline to me it s really closer to the recline you get with an airplane seat and while there are newborn options for this model i d personally recommend avoiding them given the model s otherwise small size fragility and poor terrain capability capping the model s age span at the other end is the fact that while there is a small umbrella style adjustable leg rest there s no actual foot rest on the label which means that as soon as your child has long enough legs that they don t receive sufficient support from the leg rest they ll wind up dangling downwards with nothing to anchor them this isn t a total deal breaker of course and fits with the model s bare bones short trip style i suppose but it definitely limits comfort for children older than 18 months or so to a few hours at a time moving on to quickly address other elements of the seat the streamlined theme continues and the textile quality on the lebel is what one generally gets out of cybex s gold range meaning pretty cheap feeling yet still built from strong enough materials to not fall apart right away the canopy is sparse as well without any form of extension or sunflop and offers a bit less than desired sun coverage in my opinion as far as parent comfort and ease of use are concerned one of the biggest improvements made to the original pocket design with the label is the fold which is a lot easier to flip open making that origami-like two-step fold significantly more worthwhile in my opinion and when folded down like the pocket the label definitely offers one of the smallest folds on the current market note here that there are however larger and significantly better models that still fold down sufficiently small enough to fit in the overhead compartment of an airplane or train the label just takes this to another level in that its fold is so small that you could even fit it into a suitcase and still have room for other stuff or tie it atop a rucksack personally this means very little to me i don t travel this way especially with children but i have had comments that other people find this useful beyond folding the label has a fixed handle at one meter off the ground which might be a consideration for taller people and the shopping basket is quite small and also a bit difficult to access due to the angle of the chassis arms which stretch quite far backwards as the ascent thus overshadowing the basket as far as driving is concerned the smaller five-inch wheels and weak structure of the lebel make it pretty unsuitable for any sort of rougher terrain other than perhaps fresh mowed lawn this is something of a fixed condition for the model and driving over even poorly maintained city streets for any significant amount of time is apt to cause serious looseness in the chassis there are two additional concerns here as well the first being that even over relatively smooth terrain the model is unlikely to handle all-day everyday use for longer than its guarantee period of two years if you want any sort of longevity with this model then it is really about using it purely as a travel or short day trip stroller and secondly though the model is promoted as tolerating up to 22 kilos a quick test with my son who s around 20 kilos made it quite clear that this is actually too much for the model with regards to tipping as one must do to go up curbs or really even just steering because of the way the model s arms strain and bend which over time would undoubtedly create problems with the connection points what this means is that even if you were okay with the lack of a foot rest for older children using the model with a child closer to the age and weight limit as set by cybex would likely have a serious effect on accelerating wear to the label making the model loose and rickety at best if not resulting in outright breaking something okay let s move on to the mechanics of the label then starting off with the model s general structure and the folding system which as an ultracompact is arguably the key determining factor in the overall design as far as how the system functions the activation triggers are clever all missiles go buttons at the ends of the handles which while safe enough from child intervention are always at hand and not protected by any additional safety mechanisms so if you re the fiddly and absent-minded sort be careful to avoid the idle habit of strafing enemy aircraft while your child is seated internally the system then rounds two 90-degree angles on either side in order to activate cybex s standard mid-arm located locking mechanisms allowing several horizontal hinged elements along the chassis to unfold into position the key point taking the pressure for all of these points is still those locking mechanisms mind you and on top of the horizontal hinges are three hinge crossbars facilitating that extra horizontal fold which while they do allow the model to fold smaller than most other ultracompacts they also bring with them an additional plane of looseness as a side note here the crossbars are good better than what was there on early model gb pockets but a lot of looseness and potential for symmetry problems could be avoided by creating some locking points for the horizontal fold as well as one sees with horizontally contractile models like the boogaboo donkey for example overall then like the pocket the lebel s ability to fold down horizontally as well as vertically is another one of those elements firmly placing the model as a limited use travel and short day trip type model it s a way to cheat the inherent contradiction in wanting a competitively sized seat with a smaller fold but the trade-off is a reduction in how much wear the model can sustain before all of those extra connection points loosen making the model too rickety for comfortable use if not outright leading to brakes or alignment issues with the internal mechanisms moving on then down to the rear frame of the model note that with the lebel cybex has abandoned that mainly superficial suspension that they tend to apply to most of their models despite its severely limited effect on any of those in the smaller size categories the lebel s rear wheels are not removable which positively allows for a sturdier connection though negatively means that one can t easily get into the rear wheel housings to fix potential problems with the brake pins and since the quite strange wire-based brake system mounted on the rear crossbar doesn t have adjustment screws and is also riveted together it s fair to say that even if the model survives the potential for looseness problems higher up failures in the brake system will likely be a fatal problem for most users looking lastly at the front frame then the label is actually built quite okay in relation to the rest of the model firstly the front wheels have a certain degree of suspension built into the forks which is not exactly necessary as everything else on the label is completely antithetical to driving over anything other than the smoothest of airport or amusement park terrain but still it s something secondly there are no swivel locks which isn t necessary with use over smooth terrain anyway and thirdly unlike the back wheels the front wheels are removable which doesn t really mean anything on its own but did allow me easy access to checking the connection between the front forks and the housings which is done quite well with o-rings and both inner and outer plastic rings on the top of the fork for protecting the front wheel housings against damage from the axle in addition to the front forks also having been pre-lubricated with a thicker grease all in all i can say relatively safely then that the front wheels are unlikely to be the first thing to go on this model in the long run even if you don t hold to my advice of sticking to smoother terrain so would i recommend buying the cybex label despite all the negative things i said while discussing the model s mechanics the answer to that is actually not a clear no the label has a place in the market it s essentially the same place occupied by the gb pocket only the bell is built better and at least that way i feel that good babies sort of shot themselves in the foot with this one especially since the lebel only costs around 20 bucks more than the pocket and just the single as opposed to dual wheel setup would have been enough of an improvement to justify that price hike in short then if you re looking for an ultra compact for a child between 6 to 18 months for a specific trip or two to a destination that you know to be very smooth terrain wise like disney world for example and you also definitely have packing considerations that necessitate a stroller small enough to fill only half a suitcase thereby excluding similarly priced but better engineered models like baby jogger city tour 2 then you should definitely consider the cybex lebel additionally please note that in the same breath i d like to make a correction for anybody immediately jumping from this video to our review of the gb pocket plus if this is the sort of model that you re after then the lebel is definitely better and in my opinion the pocket has now been hereby relegated as irrelevant by its own creators in any case we hope you found this video interesting and if you did we asked you subscribe as it helped us to continue making

Mima Xari Stroller,Mima Xari Stroller Review by Baby Gizmo,Hollie Schultz of Baby Gizmo reviews the Mima Xari stroller.,i0MRmubP2-c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0MRmubP2-c,571206,1165,2014-03-05T02:54:43Z,"Music hey everyone it s Holly from baby Gizmo today we re taking a look at the new Mima Zari luxury stroller now this is a luxury stroller that comes with a luxury price you need to want a contemporary modern really cool looking stroller that has some pretty fantastic features to get into this one now the Zari has a seat that holds the bassinet car cot piece for it to turn it into a pram inside the seat so there s no need to store Cary cot separately it also has great maneuverability and look how cool it looks it s something that s going to stand out on the street so let s take a look now this stroller I m telling you it s Ultra contemporary very very cool to look at so let s start with the seat the seat has a weight capacity of 45 lb if you are in Europe it s 37 lb but the US weight capacity 45 lbs they tell me it is 13 1 2 in wide has a 20in seat back from the back of the seat to the the top of the back of the seat and since the canopy see is it pretty much hits the top of the seat it s not much higher you get 21 in from back of the seat to right here so it s not a very tall seat back um but again 45 lb weight capacity there is a 8 in leg drop and that s where the seat breaks to where they Place their feet there is a removable Bab bumper bar I love the fact that is covered in the same material the leather material that is on The Handlebar so and it s removable so there s no foam anywhere in sight I love that now let s talk about the seat pad and the fivepoint harness now here s the thing when you buy the Zari um in Europe I think they call it the Shari but you re telling me in the US we re calling it The Zari x a r i so if you re in Europe you re I m probably saying it wrong um you are going to buy the stroller with the seat that has the car cot inside um but you are going to need to buy the starter pack as well you can t buy the stroller without the starter pack or the Comfort pack because you need this seat pad because it has the the fivepoint harness attached you can t use it without the fivepoint harness right the reason they did that is because they want you to be able to pick your own color um there s eight different colors that you can get in this is the pink it gives you that pop a color the outside of the stroller comes in four colors this is the white not white is for everybody but it is gorgeous comes in chocolate brown camel and black um so you ll choose the color of the stroller then you will and that is 1,070 yes very luxury price then you re going to need to spend another 130 for the starter pack that includes the seat pad the fivepoint harness and the mattress um that goes into the carry cut so you were talking 1 12200 just let s just say the stroller is 12200 because you need to buy that pack in order for it to work um so it does have a fiveo harness um when you get that extra pack um I it s very very easy to take off to clean there s a whole informational video from Mima that they ve done on how to attach it and everything love that but this seat pad that is literally pretty much locked onto the seat once you do it right I love the fact that it s not going to be falling off all the time and the material that this stroller is made out of all of the white that you see here it is an Eva material and what that means to pretty much just the normal person it s easy to clean it s very durable it creates kind of like a protective shell around your baby so it s an Eva material um the seat has three reclined positions it s a one-handed lever back here all you have to do is lift up and that is going to have it all the way back into a nearly flat recline as you can see the seat kept its shape um but it is newborn friendly there are it does become a travel system with specific car seats check their website you do need to get the car seat adapter separately though um the seat is also reversible let s put the seat up the seat is reversible like all luxury strollers it s easier if you have the canopy back because the buttons are kind of small you push those in you lift it up you still have all the three recline positions um so I love the fact that the seat is reversible The Handlebar is adjustable up and down goes from 36 in from ground to handle all the way up to 43 in now let s talk about the canop this is a unique canopy some are going to love it some are going to hate it it is a hard shelled canopy in three panels kind of slides out like that depending on how much sun coverage you need there is no peekaboo window there s nothing at all I mean it s not even like you can kind of peek so you re going to have to walk around again luxury strollers don t seem to like their peekabo windows so um no peekaboo window but the canopy it s a big canopy it s just a little bit different now let s talk about the wheels that the Zari rolls on now you know fancy people they can t be bothered with a flat so these are no flat Wheels 10 in in the back 7 and 1 2 Ines in the front they are a pu Eva Tire which is made of the same material as the soles of athletic shoes so they are resistant they are durable they are shock absorbing um they re really really great wheels and here s the thing I took it out in the snow today I wanted to try it out for all our cold weather Mamas and I was surprised it did extremely well there it s rubberized so it has a strip here so it really grips the ground I expected it to slide all over the place and it didn t it did extremely well in icy and um snowy conditions now it s not going to go through 2 feet of snow of course but it did really really well so if you re in like New York City and you have a lot of snow in the streets this one s going to do great the re the both Wheels actually all the wheels are removable with the touch of a button front wheels these are swivel wheels so it has great maneuverability but has the ability to lock straight so in case you wanted to go over a little bit allterrain you know some grass and some Mulch and you know things that moms go over so I like the fact that the front wheels do lock and um like I said these tires they are topnotch there is also a on step break here so it s flip-flop forly because you just have to step down on it with your foot you lightly lift up on it and there and it takes the break off now it s time to talk about the storage now not everybody s going to be crazy about these two baskets but did you hear that it does have two storage baskets and they both have lids so that you can keep the contents of your basket private so people aren t checking out which are carrying around um so this back one has a lid that opens up like this there is a rain cover that you can keep stored down there um which is great it comes in its own little pouch now this basket it doesn t seem very big right but it does have a bag piece that comes up like this you could cinch it closed so you could put some extra stuff and P full like that or you could just throw some loose Essentials in it and keep it closed now there s also a front basket here again they re not big they re I mean this is not a stroller that you re going to haul a whole bunch of stuff on this one the lid lifts up and then you can put a few you know maybe some water bottles or something small down here um but those are the two storage options there s no cup holder or parent tray or parent pocket it s a very clean stroller with a lot of clean lines nothing to clutter it up I m sure you could add a cup holder if you wanted um but that is the storage folding the stroller is very easy to do you just want to make sure you do it correctly so that you don t mess up any of this beautiful fabric and you want to make sure your canopy is put all the way back now this is the important part put your handlebar all the way up otherwise it s going to get dirty it needs to be up there are two safety buttons here you re going to push those in while lifting up the levers and gently put down the handlebar lift up on the frame in order for the front wheels to slide under as you can see the handlebar is not setting on the ground now if you had to put it back it would be sitting on the ground otherwise the correct way to do it is so that all of the stroller sets on the wheel so none of this gets dirty the stroller weighs in just over 28 lbs it is not a lightweight stroller this one it s heavy because the fact that the carot is inside the seat um but it is very durable it s very stable if you wanted to take the seat off um which they recommend doing um then the chassis is only 20 pounds and then it s going to you know distribute the weight a little bit better um there also if you you it s better to take off the seat because there is a carry handle um that you will see cuz if you take it off there s a carry handle right here unfolding this stroller not too hard to do you re just going to have to learn the method on how to do it going to lift up in The Handlebar then you re going to want to scooch out those front wheels until everything locks into place and put your handlebar where it is appropriate and put out your canopy now remember I told you that the seat has the carry cot inside to let it become a pram and I m going to show you how to do that right now you re going to remove the seat from the chassis remove the baby bumper bar then there are zippers around the outside of the shell you re going to have to also remove your candy that s going to let you get to the zippers even better plus you re going to need to put that on your um car cot anyway so you remove those two undo both zippers and then you re going to open it up like this your car cot is inside so when you re not using the seats you re then going to go ahead and put the shell into you know put it away for that time you take the carry cut and there are pieces in here that you have to push in to create the sides of the carry cut there once you have positioned those correctly that s going to give the stability to the carry cut now with the starter pack you get the mattress that goes into the carry cut like that because we have the pink one it gives a pink mattress you go ahead and you put your bumper bar on like that you also then want to attach your campy it s going to go over here to attach to the prongs that it sets Applause on there is also the um cover that snaps right to it like that on either side and there you go that is your car cut that was stored inside of your seat um you could also get a foot muff so separately I really really think this looks pretty fancy and let me show it to you on the frame so then you just take the carry cut and pop it right on the chassis like that and you have yourself a pram I also did want to let you know that when it was in the toddler um toddler seat the stroller seat and this way the the um seat and the pram has two height positions there s a lever here and you can bring it up even closer to Mom so as you could see you could do it from either way um there are two buttons here and that it s going to bring it down a little bit or you can bring it up so it does have two highight positions um like I said this is a luxury stroller it costs 1,200 one of the most expensive luxury strollers that you can buy um but if you re looking for a luxury you know set of wheels for your baby this one might be it comes in four different colors um the stroller with the canopy and all of where you see white there s four different colors and then the color that comes with the starter pack there s eight different colors um it is a luxury stroller I love the details of the handlebar piece that this piece also Zips off um it s very very easy to wipe down now maybe winter White s not your color because it could get really dirty but they have darker colors as well um just very modern Ultra contemporary looking um you re going to turn some heads with this stroller if this is the one for you now before I let you go I wanted to just show you the mimo winner outfit this is to spice up your stroller in the winner and Chicago winners they are brutal so sometimes you want to have a little fun with your stroller so it comes with a hand moth it s super soft inside keeps your hands warm while you re pushing the stroller it comes with a canopy cover that has a fur trim super fun super JLo um looks just it looks really fancy and if you re going to push a stroller this fancy why not make it a little bit more fancy in the winter plus it comes with the foot muff it is super soft inside very very comfy for your baby attaches to the stroller and it comes with a wind guard for when you put it into the pram mode with the bassinet this is going to cover it so the wind doesn t go into the bassinet really really cool again it s an accessory so it s going to cost more but I just love the fact that you can you know spice up your stroller for the winter it also there s an accessory a cup holder accessory that just Clips right on on either side rotate PES depending on you know what angle you need it at so I really think this is a good accessory to add as well so just wanted to kind of show you the winter outfit and the cup holder so there you go that s my look at the mimari don t forget to like us on Facebook and please subscribe

GB Pockit Stroller,GB Pockit All-Terrain vs All-City Compact Stroller,"GB is known for their compact folded strollers, so today we compare two of their larger Pockit strollers the All-City and the ...",CVDSNdbBhIs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVDSNdbBhIs,336179,1971,2020-11-16T04:37:00Z,a couple things to notice uh all city only has one set of wheels whereas the all-terrain has doubles all the way around uh it also has locking front wheels which is required for the compact fold all right we zeroed out the level on the wall and the all-terrain has more of a recline than the all-city city all terrain we re looking at about a 32 degree recline and the all city and the all city we re looking at about a 23.4 degree recline all right just real quick some key feature differences already pointed out the double wheels on the all-terrain versus the single wheels on the all city the all city has suspension in the front for a little smoother ride and of course the brake on the back essentially located that locks both wheels and unlocks both wheels sorry about the noise uh the brake on the all-terrain is just on the right wheel just flip that down and it also has the cable to lock both wheels at the same time the lower construction of the all-terrain is all plastic whereas the all city the all-terrain has a rubber strap at the bottom but a much smaller basket than the all-city and the lower frame is plastic whereas the all-city that s going away there is aluminum the upper portion of the all-terrain is also aluminum but as you can see the telescoping arms here there are two of them for stability and even then you can see that it s it s pretty flexible i ll be nice in the way i say that it does feel flimsy but it s because everything folds there s a lot of moving parts on it so of course it s not going to be very rigid the all city on the other hand it just has the two main telescoping poles that come out of the frame and so it tends to be much much more stable you can tell the difference in price between these two obviously the bottom has a much larger basket accessible from the front and from the back it also has the leg rest that can be adjusted upward i will say that the all-terrain reclines a lot farther back than the all-city while they re both very narrow they re not narrow enough to fit through my kitchen now the hood of the all city is much more rigid it s got a large it has a large aluminum band uh maybe not aluminum but some type of metallic band probably a tempered steel in the front here and uh also one in the back the one in the middle is just a flexible wire now the all-terrain on the other hand it has a plastic band in the front so not nearly as rigid and definitely once it s been bent a certain way it kind of holds that form it does have two wires in the back but you ll notice it s not connected so there s a large opening both on the right and the left whereas the all-terrain or sorry the all city is sealed up even in its completely reclined state it is all sealed up as you can see the unfolded dimensions are pretty much the same with both the all-city is a little wider than the all-terrain but for the most part they re almost exactly the same size uh what people buy them for obviously is not their unfolded dimensions but they re folded dimensions which we will now demonstrate so one thing you don t see in all the demonstrations where they show you how fast it opens and closes is there s two things that you have to do before you can even fold it up the first thing is you need to fold the back legs in and you also need to lock the front wheels so unless you ve been driving around in straight line you probably have your front wheels unlocked that they caster well before you can fold it you have to lock those wheels back into place where it won t hold up properly now once it folds up you push your two buttons you have to push down this is where i use my foot to kind of hold it and as i push down it then folds up you have to make sure that the legs don t come undone as you go down otherwise one of them will be stuck out if you pull it up hard enough it will lock into place so it won t drop back down Music you can see just a little bit of pressure takes it back out though so be careful and then as i said push the button you got to use your foot to kind of help you and then it folds up that springs into place which is easy right now but it s hard to get it back out and then you lock it so there you go it mostly stands on its own um it s basically balancing on these two joints which is why it s not the most stable if you bump it it will fall over all right now of course with the all all city it s a much simpler design it doesn t have the stabilization bars on the back it s a lot more stable it doesn t wiggle as much um the front wheels you don t have to lock them you can fold it exactly like it is and there s no legs in the back to fold up there s a downside to this of course which you ll see in a moment so the fold up is a lot simpler no the leg rest does need to be folded there s a good thing about this one it s got the kickstands it s got two plastic pieces here so that it can stand up very easily on its own it doesn t fall back down as you can see the downside to being a simpler fold is it s five inches taller it is an inch and a half narrower they re both about eight inches thick um with the canopies if you go with just the regular pocket plus they re a lot thinner because the canopy is just a single flap that folds over but as you can see um the instability in the in the chair itself you make up for it with the size it s also about a pound and a half two pounds lighter and of course the pocket plus is about three pounds lighter than this one so you actually make a big difference there when you re traveling obviously the biggest thing is do you need space do you need something that s going to be very compact that you can fit into an overhead compartment on air on an airplane or do you need something that s going to be much more functional larger basket more room for the child a more stable easier fold and unfold um then you re going to be going with the all city versus the all terrain or one of the other pocket pluses now for the unfold we ll start with the uh the all-terrain first it s definitely not the easiest unfold um in the videos they make it seem so simple but it s kind of spring loaded into place here so you almost need to hold the back side as you force the front side out then once it s out now you have to unfold your legs now you can either hit the switch or you can just force them out because they don t lock in place very well but if you re still not done go extend the arms and you have to unlock your front wheels or you won t be able to turn so a few more steps but definitely doable i ll show you the the canopy flips out like we talked about not nearly as strong as the other one has holes in the back and i noticed on a couple unfolds the uh the backrest it clips into the the bars up here sometimes those pop out so you may have to fix that as well it s definitely not as convenient i don t know how many times i ve unfolded the one in the video so that it happens so easily but it s not nearly that easy when they re new um it does recline quite a bit more than the old the all city does and then you can unzip this and recline it even more as far as the all city this one is definitely as easy as they show in the videos but i ll show you the uh the recline on this one is definitely not as shallow as the all-terrain so if your child wants to lay back a little bit more obviously the all-terrain has a better recline than the all-city the old city does have little leg rest that will pop out there so they can kick their legs up a little bit um the nice thing about the old city like you talked about is the enclosed sides so to some basically the biggest thing is if you re traveling you re going to want to go something a little bit more compact it s not as easy to open and close but it ll save you some weight in your luggage and be easier to to carry around if you re looking for something a little more functional i would definitely go with the all city it s got the nice and close sides for the canopy if your child s sleeping or something like that but most of all it s got the larger basket the sturdier frame it is a very easy fold and unfold for getting in and out of the car so if you re traveling with the child in a small vehicle i would definitely recommend the all-city over the all-terrain or any of the other pockets and also they both come with the amounts for a car seat so if you have an infant you could easily mount an infant seat into them as well

UPPAbaby MINU V2 Stroller,Could this be the best new travel stroller? Uppababy Minu V3 initial review travelstroller,,HJzMgjCD5Yc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJzMgjCD5Yc,3194,96,2025-03-02T04:24:03Z,the new upab baby menu V3 is here and I am so excited about the changes not only does it have this great carry strap it s now iata certified which means it will fit in the overhead bins of an airplane which is so nice the seatback is tall and comfortable I love the adjustable calf rest for your baby and the lower foot rest for your toddler I think the stroller is going to grow really well with your child the canopy is nice and I love the peekaboo window that it actually stays open but the newborn compatible recline is just so nice they have this little Nest mode and it s also going to be great for your toddler naps as well well because of that nice tall seatback you can see the mesh and the canopy also works good for added air flow and then I love that they actually have built-in adjustments to make it work well for your newborn this is something you don t see on a lot of the competition I love that the basket still holds 20 lbs which makes it great for travel and how tall the seatback is this stroller also only weighs 16.7 lbs and I m excited to share my full review after using it for a few weeks let me know if you have any questions below and what strollers you d like to see this compared to

strollers to Disney yes 12 strollers with my three kids and in this video I m going to be sharing about the best Disney strollers from Singles to doubles whether you can bring wagons and Rider boards we re going to cover it all so keep Music watching if you re new here I m Emily I m the Stoller Mom I m a mom of three kids ages four and under and what makes my Channel Unique is I actually use the products with my three kids and give honest review from a mom s perspective if you haven t already be sure to subscribe to my channel it helps out so much and don t forget to like comment below with any questions and Shop through the links below cuz I do have a few discount codes for these strollers now before I jump into single strollers I do want to mention that I m going to cover a lot from Singles to doubles to wagons and more so be sure to check out the timestamps below if there s a specific section you re looking for the good news about single strollers is they are all approved at Disney so you don t have to worry about whether your stroller is approved like you do with wagons and doubles however there are certain things that make a single stroller better for Disney versus others now I will say I saw every stroller Under the Sun at Disney all different kinds of Brands so there are a lot of options to choose from but some things that make a really good Disney stroller are things like a good basket for storage a good canopy and a nice seat for those naps in the afternoon and one of those strollers that s really great for Disney and great for those of you with older kids is the Baby Jogger City Mini GT2 this stroller can hold up to 65 PBS making it great for your older kids as well as has a good seatback and a really good recline for naps on the go I love how the footrest adjust best and comes up making it great for your child s naps my three-year-old who s 998th percentile had a great nap in this stroller it has a good canopy while the basket leaves a little to be desired you see these strollers all over Disney and with good reason you also can rent them which I ll talk about here in just a little bit but this is a great option for those of you with older kids another good single option that s good for those of you with little kids is the Mocking Bird single to double this is a great fullsize stroller it s actually the stroller I had when I had my first baby you can get a bassinet there s tons of accessories including an infant insert which is great and this stroller has an amazing basket holding 25 lbs I do have a code for this stroller as well that gets you a parent cup holder so check that out below but it gives you a lot of Versatility while still having a great canopy things like snack trays and is a really good option for Disney now let s say you don t want to do a fullsize stroll and you re looking for something more of a travel stroller something that s going to be great for your flight there and when you re at the parks well two really good options and they re both affordable are the Bombi BB V2 this stroller gives an amazing fold has a great canopy a good basket and a good push for a travel stroller we took this one all around Disney and I loved it I thought my baby was comfortable and it was great now I did wish there was a little bit of ventilation in the back of the seat when they were trying to take naps but I do have a full post on stroller fans so check that out below I do have one that s a misting fan and that one definitely helped and I also have a coupon code for this one where you can get a snack tray so check that out below as well now the biggest downside on the bombie is that is 18 lbs so if you want a lightweight stroller that you can just throw over your shoulder you may want to look at the Zoe tour the Zoe tour has a great canopy it also has a nice basket and a really easy fold it just folds right in half and it s very lightweight weighing only 13.2 lbs I love the snack tray and the accessories that Zoe has with their strollers and I have a 15 off code so check that out below so now that we ve talked about singles let s talk about double strollers because there are more limitations when it comes to double strollers at Disney but thankfully nowadays most sidebyside strollers are Disney approved they re under that 31 in wide and 52 in long so pretty much every side by-side double stroller you re going to be able to take the Disney but here are some options that I think are really good and I ll kind of break them out by each category now a really great double stroller option especially for those of you with older kids is the Bob double it is great for naps on the go has an amazing canopy and a really nice push and something that I found because Bobs are all over Disney is they have like a lower foot rest for your child that your older kids can also sit and rest their legs on now I m sure Bob does not recommend this so keep that in mind but I did talk to several parents who used that feature at Disney and they loved it now the story doesn t have the biggest storage so keep that in mind in getting a good parent organizer and I will say if you re having to take the transportation especially at Disney World keep in mind that the Bob does have a pretty big fold so just something to know another option that I was so excited and loved having at Disney was the menu Duo this stroller is brand new so I didn t have the snack Trace but hopefully when you buy it it will have the snack Trace so I ll link them below but this stroller offers a newborn ready recline which makes it great for your little ones at Disney not many side by sides offer this and so it s better than keeping your baby in a car seat being able to have that newborn ready recline is great for your baby on the go but also those of you who have older kids my four and a half-year-old who never naps in the stroller was able to lay down on this and some things that Uppa baby did really nicely that make it a great Disney stroller is they actually have like a mesh panel behind the seat that you can open for added air flow during naps they also have a place where you can put an air tag in the basket making it easier to find your stroller which I m actually making a video on because if you have a black stroller at Disney being able to identify your stroller is really important so check that out below now if you are going to be flying with the menu Duo I do recommend buying a travel bag and up a baby actually sells one with a warranty I know it is more money but it is worth the money to protect your stroller because Airlines do not take care of your stroller so I ll link another option below if you are taking a different double stroller and want that option but something to keep in mind and if you are flying to Disney and you want the best stroller for your trip to Disney you may want to look at the silvercross jet double this stroller is Compact and made for air travel it offers really plush padded seats and it s still going to do a great job at Disney with its nice basket make sure you get a parent organizer I ll link my favorite one below but this stroller is going to give you a lot of space and it s very lightweight under 20 lbs next this wouldn t be a best Disney stroller if we didn t talk about the Zoe twin the Zoe Trio and the Zoe quad now because wagons are not allowed at Disney the Zoe strollers allow you to transport more than one kid around the park at Disney they are approved and they make it so nice plus I m pretty sure the Zoe twin has one of the best baskets for Disney it s just nice and deep while it only holds 10 PBS I was able to load this basket up I also love the canopy and Zoe kills it in the accessories for Disney they have side bags you can add straps that make it easier to carry on Transportation now don t get me wrong when you re pushing the trio or the quad it s like pushing a boat but being able to transport multiple kids around Disney without having multiple strollers is so nice we used the trio with my three girls on our last day and it was a really good option oh and I have a 15 off code so check that out below I will say if you re going to use this for every day and you want to elevate your push I do think the allterrain wheels are worth it but it does make the stroller a little bit heavier now let s say you re looking for a stroller for one child and then the option for your other one to rest their legs well the juvie Caboose is a great option that is Affordable they have a few different options depending on features you re looking for but it also allows you to have a second child CL CL on and off as they need their legs rested and it is approved at Disney now let s talk about what things are not allowed at Disney there is a lot of debate on whether Rider boards are allowed at Disney and whether wagons are allowed at Disney in fact when I was there last week there were so many wagons now wagons are allowed at Disney when used for medical purposes so you will see a tag on many wagons that will say this however Disney was being very nice when I was there and I heard several people were allowed to bring it but only one time it was a one-time exception for some reason Disney does not allow wagons and I don t exactly know why I ve heard different things but it s something to keep in mind if you do not have a medical exemption for bringing your wagon you should not bring it because I also have Instagram DMS that say parents were forced to walk all the way back to their Airbnb 20 minutes or all the way back to the car which the parking is often not near the entrance to the park to store their wagon because Disney would not allow it so it really is at the discretion of the employee you re talking to and so one of the strollers I just me mentioned or renting a stroller is definitely going to be a better option than bringing your wagon when it comes to Rider board there s some debate according to Baby list they say in 2023 Rider boards were now allowed I saw them all over Disney but if you look on their website they say any trailer like object is not allowed at Disney what I will say is this one s a little bit more worth the risk for me and if you know if you re local to Disney and you have some insight please comment below and I ll pin it to the top but I think it s worth the risk because you can put it in your basket if you need to they re not as big and bulky and it could be a really great option for your older kids who need to rest their legs so if any of you have any insight on this let me know below all right so I just went over some great Disney strollers do you rent a Disney stroller do you rent from a third party company or do you buy your own honestly that s going to be different for every family now something I will say if you re looking at renting a stroller from the Disney parks I did rent one to try out and I would not recommend it the canopy is not good there s no seat recline no storage and it s honestly not a great push plus it s kind of expensive and I will say while I was there they actually ran out of doubles so if Dad was standing in in front of me with two little kids and he was not able to get he had to get two single strollers so just something to keep in mind I think a better option would be to rent through a third party which I actually have a blog post down below they have strollers like Baby Jogger Bob and juvie like the ones I just mentioned today you can also even rent like a Zoe Trio or quad and it ends up being almost the same price if not less than if you were renting from Disney and they deliver it right to your hotel or your Airbnb I hope this video was helpful let me know what questions you have below and don t forget to shop through the links below because I do have a lot of discount codes and I ll be sure to link my best Disney stroller fans parent organizers and accessories below thank you so much for watching

UPPAbaby MINU V2 Stroller,UPPAbaby MINU V2 Review Still the Best Compact Stroller?,This is a review of the UPPAbaby MINU V2. In this video we ll cover all aspects of the stroller and discuss whether you should buy ...,Ui69su1Qgjc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui69su1Qgjc,87094,594,2022-09-26T18:01:50Z,hey guys Andrew here with Dad verb we re going to get a look at the upper baby menu V2 and check out some subtle differences compared to the menu V1 and see if this is a compact travel stroller that you should add to your Arsenal or if you should make a pivot now this is my favorite type of stroller to use I love that it has a small profile and can quickly open at a moment notice now the stroller weighs about 17 pounds so in line with most of the high-end compact strollers and the market uh you know give or take a pound or two and it s ideal for travel being able to fit into overhead compartments on most Airlines we just did a trip to California with it and we were able to store it in the overhead compartment with no problem now probably the biggest update that we re looking at with the V2 compared to the original option is gonna be largely centered around the canopy the canopy of the older model has a UV protection flat that you would you know pull out but with the V2 they ve updated it to meet this industry standard of unzipping and expanding that third panel so very cool to see that now included in this compact at the top you can reveal that mesh peep window for added ventilation and that pocket at the rear is actually pretty awesome it s something that we use a ton on both models but one thing that I have noticed is that it feels characteristically baggier I guess you can say at the back it s not something that ever bothered me uh but now that I ve tested multiple compacts I noticed that over time it just doesn t feel as buttoned up compared to you know something like the Bugaboo butterfly it seems like there s just excess fabric flapping around and it s mostly to accommodate the recline which you know we re going to get into I don t think that this is going to deter you from buying the V2 but it s an aesthetic thing that I that I have noticed now moving on to the fold it is a one-handed fold exactly the same as before where you slide the lock under the handle and press the button at the front it folds down to a fairly compact state but one thing to note is when comparing it to the V1 it feels like it has a slightly thicker side profile it s just very subtle and I think that can be attributed to the bumper bar which now comes standard with the V2 so you know a good trade-off another minor change is how the locking mechanism is now spring-loaded rather than being held with a single flexible piece of plastic and like before you can open it from the ground up or while holding it at chest level the bumper bar is accented with a very nice leather and complements The Handlebar at the top but you can leave it off or just swap it out altogether for another add-on accessory like their snack tray on that note there are a bunch of accessories that you can check out but one noteworthy highlight is that their new Mesa car seat adapter can now fold down with the stroller which amends a major issue with the previous model where you had to clip them on and off every single time we just got done using those adapters and the V1 in our trip to California and it was massively annoying I mean the the menu was great for our flight and the trip itself but I mean if you plan on using your menu with a Mesa car seat pretty regularly I would highly recommend you buy the V2 over the over the V1 with those new adapters um well then again I don t know if those new adapters apply to the V1 but if they don t then yeah definitely invest in the V2 over finding the V1 at a lower price on somewhere like Facebook Marketplace moving on to the seat not much has changed here with their standard five-point harness it ll support Littles up to 50 pounds and has a semi full recline so not a complete lay flat feature like we ve seen with you know the Ergo Metro Plus for example but still something they re going to sleep in comfortably uh when our first was younger he slept in his a bunch and it was fine all it takes for a recline is a simple pinch of the strap lock but getting it back up does require your little to sit up a bit before firmly tugging the straps on either side I you know if not it s going to be pretty difficult to get it back up new for the V2 is how the calf rest can be adjusted as needed and really helps lengthen the seat pan for more Comfort when it is in its recline form lastly at the bottom we ve got a storage basket that can hold up to 20 pounds and wheels which are effectively the same as before with no major updates there you ve got you know all-wheel suspension which is fine for its category suspension with compacts and you know they re not really groundbreaking right uh but even with the V1 and the drive was always easy yet sturdy which isn t something that you always get with lightweight travel compact options uh that you know that can often feel pretty loose and janky now to round this all out let s talk about your buying decision to me the menu V2 in comparison to the V1 would be considered a major minor meaning you know I don t think the jump between the two versions is very drastic the way the upper Cruise V2 was with the V1 that was a a bigger switch which the cruise is a phenomenal stroller by the way check out my review on that when you have a chance highly recommend that uh but the slight Improvement to the canopy the addition of the bumper bar the leg rest adjustments and the improved Mesa adapter do make it a worthy upgrade but is it worthy of its 450 dollar price tag you know for me I m not as all in gung-ho about the jump like I was with the V1 back in 2018 because at the time the menu was a game changer I really set the tone for the category but since then the market is really caught up uh with a bunch of great options from kalugo and Nuna and a bunch of others so if you re asking me which is the best buy at the moment I think I I would take the Bugaboo butterfly which actually retails for slightly less at 429 as of this recording but there is a caveat to this because the menu is a very very good purchase from a brand known for taking care of their customers and a pedigree of quality now I m not saying that the butterfly is better by a large margin I mean if anything it barely edges it out for me for just what I perceive to be a more compact fold in a cleaner design not for anything related to the Comfort or push which ultimately that s the most important thing here the caveat here is if you re already in the upper baby family with options like the cruise or the Mesa as part of your system it might make more sense to just run with the menu our V1 Mesa adapts nicely with our menu and in fact we were actually dead set on traveling recently with our butterfly until we realized that we already had everything we needed on the menu to adapt to our Mesa so you know that s what we took instead and it traveled perfectly it really does live up to the hype the one thing that I will say is just don t take it on Sand uh in a recent beach trip sand got into the Locking joints a little bit and it almost like ruined uh everything about the stroller like opening the fold closing like it made it almost impossible so just try to avoid sand uh more so don t fold it and then let it rest in sand that s kind of the bigger thing to round it out we were really happy with our V1 all these years and given that the V2 isn t really packing like other worldly upgrades aside from that much approved Mesa adaptability I mean you may still find the V1 pre-serviceable for your family needs especially if you aren t picky about the canopy so if you want you can hop on Marketplace and search your local area for menu Steels closer to 200 250 range and if you would like there s also a link down below uh for the menu V2 clicking through that link

UPPAbaby MINU V2 Stroller,"Uppababy Minu V2, An Impartial Review Mechanics, Comfort, Use","In order to keep our recommendations up to date, we maintain a Buyer s Guide with a wide spectrum of models, and a lot of ...",cxCEv3UqzkM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxCEv3UqzkM,28505,355,2023-02-01T19:12:23Z,today we re finally going to do a proper review of the uppababy menu V2 that s taken all the way till now to get to Norway despite being launched last year we ve been looking forward to this one for quite a while as the menu has long been one of our favorite Ultra compacts and even though the changes accompanying the V2 update are pretty minimal it s still high time to have another in-depth look at the model so in any case I m gonna just jump right into it then going over the menu V2 from top to bottom and examining its advantages and disadvantages in terms of child Comfort ease of use performance and mechanics before ending with a discussion of which uses and environments it will best suit and starting off with some stats the menu V2 clocks in at 7.6 kilos and folds down to 32 by 52 by 58 centimeters with the bumper bar attached it can take the standard 22 and a half kilos in the seat and a full 9 kilos in the under slung shopping basket when it comes to child Comfort the menu V2 seat has a decent upright position and a reclined position that though not fully flat is still sufficient for napping the dimensions of the model seat are quite large overall with a generous width of 34 centimeters and a maximum length of 123. determined by adding up the lengths of the backboard baseboard space beneath the canopy and the distance between the seat and foot rest in practice this means that the menu V2 will remain usable all the way up until three and a half or four years old though I would note that the newly added adjustable leg rest while a nice addition is only 13 centimeters and is unlikely to provide leg support for younger toddlers in the reclined position past two years old or so as far as other aspects of the seed are concerned the menu V2 has somewhat softer textiles than the older version and the canopy has been upgraded with the standard extra portion zipped into the back which is a more pleasant way of expanding the canopy in my opinion and slightly improves what was already pretty adequate Sun coverage moving on to parent Comfort the menu V2 has a fixed handle height of 104 centimeters and a larger and more accessible shopping basket than what one finds on most Ultra compacts folding the model is easy can be accomplished with one hand and the process feels quite sturdy in terms of the mechanisms which is nice and something that can definitely not be said of all strollers of this size when folded down the menu V2 is pretty bulky versus other Ultra compacts and though it has both a handle and a shoulder strap it s not the sort of stroller that you ll want to have to carry around for long periods slung from your shoulder the folded dimensions of the menu V2 are unfortunately not within the iata s guidelines for cabin luggage and my experience talking with parents is that a lot of airlines won t let you take it on the plane but it does fall down to within widely accepted standards for gate checking and it s also of a very convenient size for packing in the trunk or other situations where you might appreciate a small folding stroller as far as driving is concerned the menu V2 has a sturdy rigid feel not loose side to side and also has both well above average suspension for a model of this size and larger than average rear wheels that further contribute to shock absorption as well as easier curb popping the menu V2 is of course not built for any real off-roading but can handle gravel dirt roads broken sidewalks and so on without either feeling too jittery thanks to that shock absorption as well as without risk of loosening up too much as a result of wear if you need to Traverse such conditions as an everyday thing all right let s move on to the mechanics of the model then beginning with the folding system and the overall structure of the chassis where the menu V2 uses a similar setup to up a baby s larger models the cruise and Vista V2 built simply and involving predominantly metal internal components most importantly thick cleverly angled rectangular steel pins within the folding locks themselves which are protected by reinforced housings from loosening up and wearing down as a result of steering pressure and the larger structural design of the chassis is equally impressive where the menu V2 in my opinion probably has the sturdiest skeleton of any Ultra compact on the market with strong reinforced hinges and connection points and a ton of support bars both vertically in the way the handle arms connect with the bars running down to the front frame above the Locking point of the fold and also horizontally with support from the front frame a welded rear crossbar a central crossbar a sturdy set of support struts involved with the seat and the handle itself moving down to the rear frame the mini V2 again has quite nice and noticeable suspension do both to the way it s angled as well as a proper degree of tension in the springs the model s brake system however is not my favorite sort of setup involving two pedals and being wire based without an adjustment screw for mitigating wear over time and this sort of system does occasionally run into problems down the line in particular if it s not lubricated regularly that being said upper baby models pretty much always have complicated wire-based systems and the minuv2s is at least disassemblable and up a baby is pretty good about providing spare parts for their models should you eventually need to swap out the wire for example when it comes to the wheels the rear wheels are again built a little larger than on most Ultra compacts and the tires are made of strong rubber that tends not to wear down too quickly the wheels sit a tad looser than I d like within the housings but using the original menu as a test case I haven t really seen or heard of any problems occurring from this over time looking lastly at the front frame the wheel size is again decent and there s a bit of suspension built into the forks not to the degree that you ll notice it as much as the rear suspension but still enough to help with a bit of extra shock absorption the menu V2 doesn t have swivel locks though this is okay in my opinion as despite being capable of dealing with some of the lighter rough situations found in urban environments is still not the sort of stroller you should be taking too much off-road the connection of the front forks within their housings is protected against horizontal pressure by using two separate circumferences with the axle in terms of both the axle itself and this raised plastic lip at the bottom which distributes the stress of steering or bumpy terrain such that the axle doesn t tend to widen out the channel to the point of causing wobbling problems so should you get the menu V2 then yes absolutely despite being a bit large for cabin luggage and my having a few nitpicks with some of the peripheral elements of its design such as the brake system the menu V2 is an awesome stroller and fills a niche need for parents whose lifestyle May Point towards an ultra compact as a good choice for storage reasons for example or living in a city that has narrower than average doorways or lots of small shops but who also needs something that can hold up to regular all-day use in rougher Urban environments that may have broken sidewalks dirt paths or lighter cobblestones it also makes for a solid choice for keeping in the trunk and pairing with a car seat and it s also one of those models whose base design has been around for many years now and has proven itself to hold up quite well over time in any case we hope you found this video interesting and if you did please

Baby Jogger City Select 2 Stroller,"Baby Jogger City Select 2, An Impartial Review Mechanics, Comfort, Use","In order to keep our recommendations up to date, we maintain a Buyer s Guide with a wide spectrum of models, and a lot of ...",dv6uZdmMA9Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv6uZdmMA9Y,23028,159,2022-04-28T11:51:35Z,today we re going to be looking at the city select 2 the newest iteration of baby jogger s long-standing tandem stroller we ve repaired several selects over the years but have generally shied away from covering the model on the channel as though baby jogger has always been one of our favorite three-wheeler manufacturers we ve generally found most of their four-wheelers the select included a bit lacking that being said there have been quite a few changes with the model and given the select s quite reasonable price of around 600 bucks in other parts of the world at least here in norway it s nearly double we decided it s worth giving this newest iteration a thorough rundown discussing the model s advantages and disadvantages in terms of child comfort ease of use performance and mechanics as well as in relation to which lifestyles and environments it will best suit and starting off with some stats the select 2 clocks in at a little over 12 kilos and folds down to 96 by 61 by 30 centimeters with the seat attached though it s worth noting that removing the seat will make it more compact the select 2 can take a little over 20 kilos in each seat and 7 kilos in the underslung shopping basket as far as child comfort is concerned the model has a bucket seat with an adjustable leg rest an inside width of 30 centimeters and a total length of just under 100 centimeters measured by adding together the lengths of the leg rest baseboard backboard and space beneath the canopy with both the leg rest and canopy in their most extended positions and as such will be most comfortable for children up until around 3 years old or so the textile quality on the model seats is decent for the price with nice padding feeling soft to the touch and including a multi-layered canopy that provides good sun coverage though i would nitpick the fact that the canopy hinges don t block open as tightly as i d have liked mechanically the positional adjustment mechanisms for both the recline and leg rest are quite sturdy and there s also the option of shortening the leg rest which can be useful for fine-tuning two-child configurations when it comes to parent comfort the select 2 has an adjustable handle with a height range between 103 and 109 centimeters and a shopping basket that while large enough can feel a bit difficult to access due to the positioning of the rear crossbar folding the select two is easy involving standard handle arm located triggers that feel lighter on the fingers than the setup on the original select and when folded the size of the model isn t too bad for getting in the trunk though as i already mentioned you may need to remove the seat as far as the overall feel of using the select 2 is concerned the activation mechanisms in general versus the wider market as opposed to just the previous select take a bit more force to use than is common but feel sturdy and well fitted and this feeling of sturdiness extends to the overall chassis as well where the model s thick bars and substantial reinforced connection points are even borderline chunky feeling though also durable and free of looseness driving wise the use of 7-inch front wheels and no rear frame suspension makes the select to very much a city model capable of tackling rougher urban conditions like gravel park paths and cobblestones but not the best to use off-road and the model s length also makes it a little heavy to steer and tip in particular in tandem configurations but also as a single child model at least in comparison to some of the better competing tandems on the wider market alright let s move on to the mechanics of the select two then going over the model from top to bottom where the handle uses a wire and pin telescopic setup for height adjustment that s built quite sturdily and has internal components separate from those used to activate the rotating folding mechanisms at the center of the chassis baby jogger s long used and quite durable easy fold system which remains essentially the same as on the previous iteration while the arm mounted folding triggers by contrast are a new and very welcome update replacing handles located directly at the point of the fold on the previous version that often ran into problems a few years down the road becoming heavy to pull and even sometimes breaking as far as the overall structure of the chassis is concerned the select 2 has solid horizontal support in the form of its thick crossbars and handle and is unlikely to suffer from any sort of symmetry problems as a result of loosening down the road not that the model is likely to loosen up that much anyway due to its rather heavy duty connection points moving down to the rear frame there s again no suspension which means that though the wheels and the structure of the chassis will sufficiently absorb most shocks from broken sidewalks and other lighter rough terrain truly bumpy ground will make driving a bit jittery looking at the brake system the select 2 marks a return to the sort of foot activated setup found on earlier baby jogger models though updated a bit both in the pedal and in that it s more enclosed which is a simpler and more durable brake system than the wire-based handle mounted static brake used on the original select lubricating the select 2 s brakes a couple of times a year and flushing out road salt if you live somewhere snowy are important to prevent rust and keep the channels free of pebbles and grit but beyond this my experience is that this sort of system tends to hold up well over the years and is easier to fix than wire based setups if problems do eventually pop up when it comes to the wheels the way they lock within the rear frame makes them unlikely to develop problems with the locking mechanisms though as with the brakes a little lubrication is definitely advised the composition of the tires on the select has been a little bit of an issue in the past in terms of holding up to wear from pebbles and rougher ground where they can get a bit ugly after a few years of use though from what i can find it looks like baby jogger has changed up the formula a bit and for the overall industry rubric s foam has also definitely gotten better in the last couple of years so hopefully this will be less of a problem with the select 2. looking lastly the front frame the select 2 has standard suspension built into the forks but no swivel locks which is quite unconventional but does reduce mechanical complexity as well as fit with the urban orientation of the model where smoother streets make swivel locks generally unnecessary the forks themselves sit nice and tight in the wheel housings at least right out of the box though it s important to note that the tight connection here results solely from the use of ball bearings and since there are no suspension pads or any other form of wobble protection besides these bearings keeping the axles lubricated with a thicker grease to prevent them from rusting to the bearing so that they can be removed will be crucial as the bearings are likely to loosen down the road and require replacement so should you consider getting the baby jogger city select 2 maybe my top criterion for judging tandem models has always been that they justify their added size and weight by being competitive in terms of either terrain capability or storage capacity in the single child mode versus other single child only models and though the select 2 is better than the original in this regard it still fails in these respects versus strollers like the boogaboo fox the upper baby cruise v2 or other tandems like the vista v2 or the nuna demigrow that being said however it is a lot cheaper than these models and when comparing the select 2 then to other strollers actually within its price class it does a lot better and thus provided that a tandem model is what you re looking for that price is a strong factor in your purchasing decision and that you live in a relatively smooth environment the select 2 is a model worth considering due to its acceptable price and weight the return to a foot mounted brake system and the fact that the engineering is significantly sturdier than what is common in its price class in any case we hope

Graco Modes Nest Stroller,Graco Modes Nest Travel System Stroller Review,Graco Modes Nest Travel System Stroller Review. Graco sent me this travel system to review and it has a lot of nice features.,otAtNJ7YjYk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otAtNJ7YjYk,157236,875,2021-02-08T12:00:12Z,Music hi this is becky spechart with experienced mommy and today i am talking to you about the graco modes nest three-in-one travel system with the snug ride 35 light elite infant car seat that was provided by graco for the purpose of this review what makes this product unique is that it is three in one it has an infant car seat carrier it has a bassinet and it has a toddler stroller and there s actually quite a few competitors out there for graco evenflo hot mom bugaboo mom push maxi cozy summer infant and so many more so the previous graco modes travel system was identical to this one except now there is a slide to me function that allows you to move the infant car seat as well as the toddler seat to whatever level you want it to be to suit you or baby if you re using this as a high chair at a park or a picnic table you can slide it up high to be the height of whatever table you re at maybe you re using it for an older child sometimes and their legs are long and maybe sometimes you re using it for a baby it just gives you a lot of versatility to be able to slide that up to whatever height you want assembly was pretty straightforward but i did have a hard time putting together the big back wheels with the brakes on the stroller itself the important thing is that this spokes part is on the outside so that it can talk to the wheel that is going to slide into that piece and break okay this direction slides in the top anyways it was confusing i hope you can learn from my mistakes and do that right the first time but it s very forgiving with a flat head screwdriver if you need to pop it back out and fix it this piece has made it a toddler seat that black piece you raise it and it makes it like a toddler seat which then you scrunch one thing i noticed while i took this puppy out for a ride was that it was very smooth for me and for baby because the wheels are so big and the frame is very big just felt very easy to get out of my house and down the big steps because of that as well i love that there is so much storage at the bottom you have plenty of height in between it so a big old diaper bag can go under there okay so let s be honest mommy needs her diet coke i love that they have a cup holder for mom or dad that they re thinking about me it s very lightweight which is a big deal for me because i m the one that s normally hauling it around whether i m going out to the park or i m going to the mall or wherever i m going it opens extremely easy just have to pop out the clasp that s holding it all together and pull it forward and breaking it down is very easy to you simply squeeze and pull back and then it all just folds in and snaps in very nicely definitely not compact you d be best suited to use this in a bigger vehicle because it is pretty wide so it s not going to be great for places like bathrooms or restaurants or things like that your sweet spot with this thing is going to be taking a walk on a sidewalk or being outside in general but obviously if it s doubling as a bassinet they re thinking more along the lines of bigger space there are some strollers that are known for being more lightweight and compact but the ride isn t as smooth so oftentimes you can t have it both ways so another big sell for this travel system is that it gives you a lot of options for the direction that you re putting junior in their little pumpkin seat they can be facing forward they can be facing backwards that can be put inside the bassinet they can be put inside the toddler stroller it can slide up and down they are just very accommodating with whatever direction you want your baby to be whatever height you want your baby to be this stroller does all the things and then if you re out going on a walk and your toddler or your baby falls asleep in the toddler stroller you can just lay back and then they re laying straight on their backs let s talk about this bassinet this is such a cool feature of this stroller you take a toddler stroller and with one unsnapping of a clasp and it flattens then there s these right here that slide into here it becomes a bassinet on wheels okay but it s this black piece and what it does is it allows it to go flat like that so talk about convenient for when you re going to somebody else s house and you need a place for your baby to nap if you re staying in a hotel or if you re traveling to your parents house you have this bed in a lot of ways smaller than a pack and play you can wheel that around very easily i find that to be a huge strength any time you can take multiple baby items and make them into one have it be a multi-use kid toy it s a huge win for parents because baby stuff totally takes over your house i think the bassinet is incredibly cool i ve never seen anything like that until now so let s talk about the pumpkin seat for a minute i love the nylon breathable mesh visor i normally have these big funky kind of clunky super thick visors this thing is extremely breathable extremely bendy it shields from the sun it does all the things but it s just a lot more collapsible it allows you to move around a lot easier without being so clunky i love that i also love that the way that you change the handle back and forth is one button on the top now it is best if you re bracing yourself on some point in this thing whether it s on the bottom or the side but it s a button at the top it s not like you re having to reach around in a car seat awkwardly to clasp it and move it forward or backward it s one button at the top that allows you to push and go back and forth so that was a big plus as far as popping the base in and out of my minivan my minivan is set up in a way that s very complementary for any car seats it s got those metal hooks in a very visible easy place to click in and that s what this car seat base has and it did that with relative ease after you ve clicked them in you re supposed to tighten it you kind of have to push down on the base and pull up make sure that you weave that seat belt back up through the middle before you pull up i tried to pull up on the side and it didn t tighten at all and i was very mad okay so let s look at this thing this is new so apparently this baby has different recline positions check in the level indicator for the appropriate one all the way to the ground is one that s two that s three and that s four if the blue indicator is in the clear area the restraint is level for infants zero plus months if the blue indicator is partially in the notched area the restraint is level for a child 3 plus as far as feedback goes i would say the weakest link for this nest travel system is how the connection snaps in to the infant car seat as well as on the bassinet to the actual stroller itself it does not slide in easy i have to look at one side and then i have to go and look at the other it s not just an obvious easy click in when you re fumbling to snap your baby in holding it with one arm it s pretty awkward because of that i found myself having to find workarounds when i m trying to put my baby that s in the pumpkin seat into the stroller as long as that toddler stroller with the tray is up there first you re gonna have a lot better luck snapping that baby in breaks very important it s not super smooth how you get these into the part that click so don t ever do it with a baby in there for your convenience there is a link listed below in the description that ll take you straight to this stroller please be sure to subscribe to this channel for more helpful reviews like this in addition to lots of other helpful mom stuff this has been bec speck over and out

going to show you guys this really cool function it s got this really big vent so whenever it s hot or you know you want more air breathability just fold that up and if you want even more breathability there s this little flat back here you roll up show you guys real quick Music and then you just tie this up and you got this huge vent back here so you can actually lift this up this is for the uh you can adjust the the rear incline decline with this just pull the straps out and then if you want to um lower it you just pull it it s really simple and then we have the wheel lock in the back this rear one so whenever you re moving and then you need a stock and take your hands off the stroller completely you want to lock that in place to make sure the bag is there s also a front lock as well we don t use it a whole lot but it kind of like locks the front wheel in place as well and one really cool feature about this stroller is how much storage you actually have so back here you know i showed you the flap that you roll up it s actually got several compartments you have a zipper you could put in you know your wallet your keys your phone or whatever and then you also have two side pockets you can play like your water bottle baby bottles what else and um over here at the bottom is the really cool function it s a really big space but um more interesting is the front you can actually access it on this tab right there so whenever you re out grocery shopping or whatever you can feel free to you know put items there make sure you pay for it though don t forget that and then one secret thing that we found by accident actually i ll show you with the uh the baby car seat you can actually do front or rear we actually do a rear because we like to see kinsley and just lock it in place come on back here you have this extra pocket right here we actually found it by accident because kinsley was kicking her blankets and her pacifiers and whatever so it s extra space if you need it and then you can adjust the handlebars there s two red buttons on the left and the right but just kind of hold it push it down Music and it s really cool function with the canopy on the car seat it works with the stroller so especially during the pandemic right now you want to be as safe as possible kind of just do that like that and the baby s fully protected and then whenever you need you know extra ventilation just pull this up Music yeah so i m going to show you guys how we actually transition from inside the car to the stroller it s really cool you want to start by pulling these red levers again on the side up so you can grab the handle and then the front actually has a red lever as well pretty close everything all the buttons are pretty much red so it s pretty easy to see come on over here and the system comes with a base it s pretty easy to set up i m not going to go into it but you pretty much just click it into place that s it that s what s so convenient about this and then i like to put the handlebar back down and then put kinsley in i ll show you guys later let me show you how we put away the stroller into our car we take it everywhere we go now just because it s so convenient and yeah we can take kensei with us so i want to start by hitting this button right there and it s super simple if my wife has to take kinsley by herself she can do it just push the button and pull this up Music go straight into the trunk now i m going to show you guys how to assemble everything it s pretty straightforward as well just uh make sure you pull this black lever and it kind of folds and you just lift make sure the wheel lock is in place grab the handlebar is up and pull the red button back so i m going to show you the functions on the actual car seat so you can adjust the back depending on how you know how big the baby is and then this is actually for when the baby s young and it s like a head support make sure the head doesn t rattle but you can take this off when the baby gets older and there s actually two settings for the buckle as well so i m gonna go ahead and grab kinsley and show you how it looks like all right kenzie here we go lift this up i know she doesn t really like this process but once she s in she s usually pretty good take that arm strap good honey Music okay now that she s in place i m going to show you guys how it looks like when she s fully covered bear with me kinsley Music do that she s totally covered and then when she wants to see mommy and daddy Music usually she s not this fussy but that s pretty much it so we really really love this product it s super convenient especially like transitioning from the car to the stroller it s just seamless and it s lightweight yeah it s super lightweight the car seat itself

Britax B-Lively - Stroller,NEW 2019 Britax B-Lively Travel System Demo,"Cruise smooth with the new B-Lively 2019 stroller, featuring all-wheel suspension and a lightweight design for everyday strolling.",pcGTf7wOAGc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcGTf7wOAGc,107524,259,2019-01-01T15:21:24Z,Music the V lathi stroller comes with its own clicking bow adapters comes with the stroller so you don t have to pay for any adapter assembly makes for an easy transition from car seat to stroller when you re using any of our infant car seats they match right up with the stroller without having to purchase any additional adapters it s great if you re in the city and your baby s sleeping you can close both canopies and we have a little beef Cole right here which is great for mom to peek in and see the baby or dad or if you just want to like black it all out you can close it like that and they have a nice little nap so that s how it s used as a travel system we have two separate travel systems that you can purchase one is 3.99 including the be safe 35 and then if you purchase it with a be safe 35 elite and if you choose to purchase the be lively with the be save ultra that will be 429 so a little bit about the smaller this is an upgrade from our b-agile which has been in the market since 2010 and this be lively just came out this summer people are loving it becoming one of our best selling strollers again for these simple facts I m just gonna go right cut right to the change and show you the fold that s what usually the biggest question is for most parents when they re shopping for a new stroller and it s a one-hand fold so you can actually be holding the car seat when you re folding your stroller there s a little button on the side right here that you re just going to click in and then you pull the handle up and you re off and walking so very convenient not only is it an easy full but you can see how compact it is so it s going to fit in the back of pretty much any vehicle that you re packing and then again it s super lightweight so it does fit in that lightweight category and three really important things when you re looking for a stroller and especially for a travel stroller or one that you re going to be in and out of the car with a lot so it opens right back now we re going to walk through some of the more convenient features on the stroller such as having access to your basket so right here we actually have a larger basket than the be agile and you can access it a little bit easier because instead of having a metal pole right here that connects you can actually push down the fabric to get your diaper bag in now if your child sleeping in the reclined position back here sometimes it can be difficult to get into that basket so we ve opened it up from the front as well so you can just open that up and you have access to the basket from here now if you need extra pockets which you didn t have in the b-agile we added a zipper cap so when you go to fold that stroller you don t want everything falling out so you can add your purse I m sorry so you can add your wallet your keys and maybe your cell phone right here in the zipper pouch if you re on the go pretty quickly so we re gonna fold it nothing s gonna fall out we do have to open pouches here which you can actually fit a nice water bottle if you don t have a stroller organizer so it does hold a water bottle and some other items if you wanted to now if you re out in the Sun you want an oversized can be this one has a very large canopy it s going to protect your child that is sitting in the seat or if you re in the travel system mode and lastly you want a stroller that s going to fit your infant all the way up to 55 pounds whether they re sleeping or sitting upright and so one of the ways that we can make them more comfortable is changing the reclined position and it s very easy on our protect strollers and that you just hold these two stand apart like that and then you can see that the seat is more upright and it is a more upright seat than the stroller of two years ago so we have made some adjustments to that if you have heard about that now to recline it you just squeeze the two grace buttons right here and pull it back down very simply so it transitions very easily and this is the B lightly

The BEST jogging stroller 2020,Instagram tori.caves The ALL NEW BOB Gear Alterrain Pro jogging stroller review and feature description! New Smoothshox ...,d2gE86epLY0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2gE86epLY0,19815,72,2020-12-02T02:40:43Z,hi welcome back to my youtube channel today i m going to be reviewing the new bob gear all terrain pro jogging stroller it just came out spring of 2020 so it is brand new still i we are going to start with some of the features the all-terrain pro has that s different from previous models such as the revolution the flex and other models like that so for starters the all-terrain pro has what s called smooth shocks and it s a shock absorption technology brand new and in the all-terrain pro what that means is that it can transition from concrete asphalt sidewalk road type of terrain to a crushed gravel to a dirt trail kind of a bumpier terrain and it does it smoothly so it has that shock absorption to make the transition smooth so whether you want to take your all-terrain pro out for a trail run or you re running on the sidewalk and have to pass or go around something into the grass you don t get that bumpy transition like you would in a previous bob model which is awesome so we ve taken our all-terrain out on some dirt trails off-road and some grass and it has been fantastic i ll also add a little clip at the end of the video of a transition from smooth to rougher terrain just to kind of show that transition secondly it comes with a upf 50 weather shield shade so older models also have that as well but the all terrain has i m going to flip around so you can see it it has this magnetic part so it has the clear part you can see your kids inside it has this mesh breathable area so when it s warmer outside all you have to do is roll this sleeve up and it tucks in here that way it s out of the way whereas previous models it would velcro and sometimes the velcro gets stuff built up into it and it doesn t stick very good so magnetic perfect um it also has this storage pocket on the back i m going to take off this handlebar console that actually was for my revolution bob but it also goes on your all-terrain so if you have a previous bob model already and you have this handlebar console it does also fit on your all-terrain which is cool so this is a single because i had the revolution single and the ultra all-terrain single bob so this storage pocket can flip over there s also a mesh part underneath but the storage pocket is amazing so if you don t have the handlebar console for storage or even if you do this pocket it looks small but it actually fits foam and right now i have honey stinger gels an extra granola bar because kids always need snacks bag for when it rains some dog bags and some hand wipes so the pocket looks small but it actually fits a lot of stuff and it has a zipper enclosed weatherproof so if it starts to rain or drizzle while you re out running that s why i keep it bag just in case but it s supposed to be weatherproof so let s dip all that back in there another really cool feature that i love on the handlebars is a break now some older revolution models do have a handbrake mine didn t so i m really excited about this but a handbrake for control if you re going downhill you don t want to lose control of your stroller or if you re just trying to slow down really fast handbrake is wonderful so also another part that wasn t on my old revolution some revolution models do have this as well mine didn t is an adjustable handlebar so there s these buttons on the inside of the handlebar and if you squeeze so there s two buttons on the inside here and you just press them both and you can lower them they lock into place at really any point that you want i keep mine fairly high to personal preference my older revolution model didn t have adjustable handlebars so that s a really cool feature for me i enjoy it i like it lower when i m walking and i like it higher when i m running personal preference again but it s nice to have that ability to change your handlebar position taller people i m on the shorter side on 5 4 even though i like it higher when i run personal preference okay so we re also going to continue on the storage train underneath there is a big storage bin on the bottom and the older models have this as well but they aren t zip to close so the all-terrain storage underneath has a zipper pocket which is nice for when you get if you get caught out in the rain or it s windy you don t want stuff flying out getting wet or muddy whatever the case may be i like the fact that you can zip it shut and everything in there is safe i don t know if you can see but there are also two mesh storage pockets at the back so where your kit sits it s at their back the older models have just one big open pocket but these are two separate pockets now so we re going to go into folding the stroller up which is totally different than all the older models so the new all-terrain pro instead of doing it up here where the older models you pinch these it folds over and then you pull it it s kind of like a two three step process the newer one you just pull up on this velcro portion and then it has a yellow button and the arrows you just follow the arrows push the button when you fold and it folds in half which is super easy way easier in my opinion to get it apart and then to bring it back out you just pull it out and it snaps into place and you fold that velcro portion back down so there s still a lot of storage just like the old ones and it s definitely upgraded in my opinion from the older revolution models so i think that about does it for the all-terrain front wheel still locks and it can go into swivel the iron man versions are only fixed the all-terrains and the revolution you can go from swivel to fixed wheel which is what this yellow knob does so i have it in swivel and then you just push it in and down and it snaps into place okay i think that about does it for the all-terrain pro review thank you for watching and stay tuned there s going to be a short video at the end showing the transition from smooth terrain to rough terrain and i hope you enjoy thank you you

Silver Cross Coast Stroller,Silver Cross Coast,The Silver Cross Coast pram can be purchased as a single pram comes with a bassinet and reversible toddler seat . With the ...,AWuzaAvgkMw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWuzaAvgkMw,26328,88,2019-04-18T02:13:35Z,Music hi I m gonna talk you through the new cuff crown by silvercross the cost when you purchase this pram comes with a buck neck as Shawn displayed here a seat unit one hood one air Crenn on one bumper bar depending on what unit you re using you would unclip the hood unclip the bumper bar and move them across the state of the unit first I ll demonstrate how we use the bassinet and now to occupy the seat unit second the bassinet is designed from newborn all the way up to six six months or nine kilos you have UPF 50 plus and fabrics and you ve also got an additional Sun Visor which you can pull down and give additional some protection for Beibei you have a peer view window here so you can keep an eye on baby as well this fabric from the peer view window has magnets in so you can pull up this section of fabric on the perm and that s gonna expose ventilation and air flow pop this down and the magnets will ensure that that fabric stays in place so on a really warm day you can get that air flows through the pram as well excessive it with this pram when you purchase it you get bassinet seat mosquito net rain cover and cup holder all is standard within the one box this color is the cost in Flint the bassinet is lined with bamboo so it s breathable antibacterial and al also regulate baby s temperature so keep very nice and cool but also really comfortable in those summer months the bumper bar is easier easy removable so you ve got a button on either side that you can press and that ll just release it to get baby in and out easier the great thing about the cast pram is at the touch of a button you ve got different handle heights so depending on who s pushing the pram you can adjust the height to what feels comfortable when pushing the wheels on the pram are polyurethane so they are puncture proof you re not going to have to repair them the wheels at the moment are on locks you can see they re pretty staying in the same position to unlock them you have to clip hop that button there then that s going to give you that movement in those wheels so you d have that on unluck when you re in shopping centers or busy places so you can get that nice maneuverability however when you want bumpy roads or more multi terrain we advise keeping those wheels on lock so you can get a smoother ride for your baby as well so to lock the wheels you just clip that down like that you have a nice big basket on the cost pram that can hold all your shopping another feature of the cast pram you can see here displayed in what we call single mod but the cast pram has the opportunity to future-proof yourself so if this is the baby number one and you did get pregnant again pretty soon you don t need to worry because we can turn to change this into a double pram by purchasing an additional tandem seat so at the moment if you want to remove any of their units from the pram you lift the levers on both sides and just literally pull up and then hover over the units like that and it just clips back into place and once you hear it click you know that s safely in place so to remove it you just pull up like that so at the moment it s in what we call single position if you were turning this Pam into a double position you press that button in and flick that adaptor over and again on the same side however I think it s a cool feature to use this pram with the adapters in a higher position to give you more access to your basket or even have your baby closer to you so you can pop it into that double position and have the baby nice and high MC not bending down as much but also giving you a lot more access to that shopping basket when you re out and about so honest baby six months old or nine kilos we re going to take them out of this bassinet and move them into the seat unit as we said before the seat unit comes with the pram and again you can either pop it back into a lower position by pressing that button and clicking that adapter over or having baby in the higher position so the seat unit looks like this and as you can see we don t have the hood on there it would fit when you do have the hood it looks like this but what you do you d move the hood off the bassinet and clip it onto the seat you only get the one hood with the pram to clip the seat in you over those sections like star and hear it clicking and then you ve got different recline positions so you ve got a lever on the back of the pram here where you can slightly vac line or fully recline so it s six months baby would start off in that position this has also got an adjustable calf support here and so baby would start off like that then as the head support gets stronger you can do the slightly recline and then fully upright when baby gets a little bit older I may be a toggle and you want them to face the world you literally lift it up like that turn it round pop those in like that and again baby confess the world and you ve got those different recline positions you can collapse the frame with the seat on but the seat has to be in this position so facing up right and forward so I ll show you how to do that always make sure your wheels are unlock when you collapse in your pan which our wheels are unlock at the moment it does help if you pop your brake on as well so the brake on this pram super easy to use red to stop and then green to go great thing is in summer if you ve got sandals on it s not going to hurt your toes because you are operating the brick with the sole of your foot it s a pop your brake on put your fingers in these two sections here there s two holes on the right hand side you ve got to press a button there you pull that lever up but you also pull the lever up on the other side as well even though there s no button you push the button on the one side but pull them both up then just push down and you ll hear it click into place to release it there s a lever here and you just unclip that and pull it back up and you ll hear it click back into place or if you find it easier you can remove the seat unit and collapse it without the seat on as well because can also be a travel system so we re compatible with maxi Cosi and nuna papaya capsules you have to purchase some adapters that clip into this set in here and then you can pop your capsule on and make it that complete travel system the cost a lot as well as also across palms have a three year warranty you get your your first 12 months but if you register online within 28 days of purchase we will give you an additional two years there is a separate video that shows you how to care and clean and look after this perm to ensure it is going to last you a lifetime with regards to extending the length of this pram if you do get pregnant again we can turn it into a double pram for you all you need to do is purchase an additional tandem seat as shown here and I ll show you how that works when you buy the tandem seat that comes with its own hood and bumper bar and you ve got the hood and bumper bar off this pram as well you can create two units also in the box you will have a rain cover a mosquito net with that unit as well but you also get these adapters so you get these ones to clip on the front of the pram which I ll show you how to do that now and these wants to elevate the carried cart should you wish to have the carry cart in the top position and your tandem seat down in the bottom position so if you re going to make it into a double pram I ll show you how to do that the unclip your first unit now you have to put these into double position now you press in that button and flick the elevator over there and then again the same on that side you pop on these adapters now they do stay left and right it does help you out and that s when you re at the back of the pram so your left is on that side and your right on that side so your left one just clips on the groove here you ll hear it click in and the right one there then you can do whatever configuration you like now so you may want to if you ve got newborn have newborn up here and toddler down there so if you re wanting to do that position you get these carry car elevators and again they say left and right so you pop that one in there and the left one in there that will allow you to put your carry cart at the top like sir and then your tandem seat which is this one can go down the bottom I know this is a tandem seat because it s got those curved legs like so your main seat that comes with the firm has straight legs like that now this one always takes top position you cannot put this down in the bottom position it s always the tandem seat with the curved legs that takes the bottom of the shell so then you can pop your toddler which seems to be the most popular position with second time mums your toddler down here so they can still face out and see the world you ve got your adjustable calf support there and then you ve got your position for your newborn and your toddler your toddler can also face inwards if you wanted to so you just turn the seat round like sir pop your toddler in like that and that also gives your toddler the opportunity to have a sleep in that facing position once this baby outgrows the bassinet at six months you can go to two seats see you unclip the bassinet like so you now don t need those carry car elevators they re just for the carry cuts you can put these away somewhere safe with the carry cart the bassinet and then you re gonna go to two seat units so you don t clip the hood off your bassinet put it onto your no your new seat units then you ve got your two seats and then you can pop your other baby up here like that again you ve got your adjustable adjustable calf support on here as well and you ve got your different recline positions the birth babies can have a sleep or you can do toddlers facing opposite ways so you can turn it like that and have them facing opposite or you can have them bars facing outwards as well like so another position you can do which is a great thing about this pram you can have bassinet down the bottom and you can have total of up the top so it might be a day where your toddler needs you more than the new ball so you can pop your title up like this take off your second seat if you are still using the bassinet and part bassinet down here so there s no no rules or regulations around which place you have either child you can have your habeas down the bottom or you can have your heaviest at the top it can do in total 27 different configurations which you ll see on a slide shot like another feature we love about the cost pram is the addition of this ride on board so should you have three children that you need to get around on your day you can add this board on so it s got two red buttons here you turn that around and you ll see they move in and out as I turn those around on the bottom of the frame here it s got two holes where those sections will clip in so you twist that handle there you align where those sections will go and then just release it and you ll hear it s clipped in its are perfect if you need to get three children out and about and then if you do drop one of the children off at kinde or Grandma s you can then there s a strap that can hold this board up and to keep it out of the way we love the cast we think you re gonna love it as much as other it s really adaptable perfect for the moms that doesn t know yet what family situation she wants so you can start off with a single pram and then eventually if you do get pregnant again you can turn it into a double Music you Music

Since then we ve gotten the Jet travel ...",T1eJuVFW4JQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1eJuVFW4JQ,19148,111,2018-11-01T13:30:01Z,Music hey this is Ellie for magic beans and in this video I m going to be comparing the silver cross wave and the silver cross Coast for 2019 so we have this upper cross wave for the past couple of years as you know silver cross is one of the oldest stroller brands in the world and they are constantly innovating new strollers and I m excited about showing them to you now if you have any questions about these strollers or any other stroller you got a go to edmunds.com special questions or call us at six one seven three eight three eight two five nine or just leave a comment below if you re new to the channel on Ellie for magic beans we review and compare the latest and greatest in strollers if you want to see more videos like these please subscribe to our youtube channel today and remember the super gross weight and the silver cross coast are available from us from magic beans with free shipping so the silver cross wave is their premier new iteration of stroller now the thing that makes this unique is that it turns from a single stroller to a double stroller without having to add any type of upper adaptors and so what you ll do is you can just remove the seat and you can move this from a high position to the low position and then you can add a bassinet that comes included with the stroller and you just click it into here click click there s a magnesium alloy frame so it s super solid and sturdy for walking around the neighborhood nice long walk it s just really really excellent quality I will put this back in the upper position and the seat goes in both directions now the silver cross wave comes with car seat adapters and tandem adapters included so you could actually put the bassinet and the stroller seat on the stroller at the same time right out of the box it s their luxury stroller it s their premier stroller but they also wanted to create a new stroller for a more urban parent a little bit younger a little bit more nimble and that is the coast and so the coast has a lot of the very similar features to the wave it has the ability to go from a single - a double stroller it does not come with car seat adapters and it does not come with the tandem adapter is included but it is a lighter frame the frame of the post is 22 pounds and the frame of the wave is 26 pounds really great detailing on both of them the wheels are a little more small and a little bit more narrow but I think it would be really great for sort of walking around the neighborhood them the other thing that you need to know is when you get a ghost out of the box you only get one canopy one canopy that works on the seat and on the bassinet so all you have to do is simply remove the canopy and you attach it right to the bassinet and it only comes with one bumper bar so you remove the bumper bar from the seat and you put it on the bassinet so this is what the Silver Cross Coast NASA nut looks like with the canopy attached and with the bumper bar just a quick demonstration in order to fold this thing down all you have to do is push the button here and there s these two loops and it folds right down really easy much lighter it is really a very manageable weight when you re when it comes to a coast and I think it s really really great there is a little latch on the side you just open it up and voila there you have it one of the nice things about the boat the Silver Cross Coast Emmet s Silver Cross wave it has a higher weight capacity for the seat and for the tandem seat it s a 55 pound capacity for the actual seat and a 45 pound weight capacity for the tandem seat if you re comparing the street of a baby Vista you have a higher weight capacity for both the reen seat and the regular seat so if you have two larger children this might be a really good choice for you so I hope you like my comparison of the silver cross post and the silver cross wave both available from us from atropine s with free shipping if you like this video please give us a like and don t forget to subscribe to magic beans videos today thanks for watching
